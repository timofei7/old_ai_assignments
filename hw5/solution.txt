P1. method sP() gives a simple probability, bigramCondProb() takes a bigram
	and a third word and gives that conditional probability (p(A | B C) = p(B C A) / p(B C))
P1b.buildSentence() takes a bigram to start a sentence with and builds a 15 word sentence.
	This part is sooo cool. Make some pretty funny sentences! I trained it on Mark Twain, Gullivers Travels.
	It ran out of memory processing war and peace though. These would be better if it could be forced to
	end with word + period.

Some of my favorite senteces (using different things as training data):
what if it could be when she got done this husky up and went to
what if it just happens so that stirred up she comes next morning or else
what if it just worked noble when jim bit into nothing but bread and float
when i found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the tree he
i will now give a shriek at the figure here annexed i told his majesty
i will be linked to the scabbard i was invited by several contrivances that shall
i will make you tear your own flesh and bones birds beasts and fishes to
you will gratefully and humbly submit to incur the censure of pride singularity affectation ignorance
you will support the project gutenberg license included with this agreement you must cease using
i am able to forbear groaning and shedding tears and turning my head into his
i am not altogether so robust and that some of them breaking into the sea
