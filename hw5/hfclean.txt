EXPLANATORY

IN this book a number of dialects are used to wit  the Missouri negro
dialect the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect the
ordinary Pike County dialect and four modified varieties of this last
The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion or by guesswork
but painstakingly and with the trustworthy guidance and support of
personal familiarity with these several forms of speech

I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would
suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not
succeeding

ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN

Scene  The Mississippi Valley Time  Forty to fifty years ago



CHAPTER I

YOU dont know about me without you have read a book by the name of The
Adventures of Tom Sawyer but that aint no matter  That book was made
by Mr Mark Twain and he told the truth mainly  There was things which
he stretched but mainly he told the truth  That is nothing  I never
seen anybody but lied one time or another without it was Aunt Polly or
the widow or maybe Mary  Aunt PollyToms Aunt Polly she isand
Mary and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book which is
mostly a true book with some stretchers as I said before

Now the way that the book winds up is this  Tom and me found the money
that the robbers hid in the cave and it made us rich  We got six
thousand dollars apieceall gold  It was an awful sight of money when
it was piled up  Well Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at
interest and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round
more than a body could tell what to do with  The Widow Douglas she took
me for her son and allowed she would sivilize me but it was rough
living in the house all the time considering how dismal regular and
decent the widow was in all her ways and so when I couldnt stand it no
longer I lit out  I got into my old rags and my sugarhogshead again
and was free and satisfied  But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he
was going to start a band of robbers and I might join if I would go back
to the widow and be respectable  So I went back

The widow she cried over me and called me a poor lost lamb and she
called me a lot of other names too but she never meant no harm by it
She put me in them new clothes again and I couldnt do nothing but sweat
and sweat and feel all cramped up  Well then the old thing commenced
again  The widow rung a bell for supper and you had to come to time
When you got to the table you couldnt go right to eating but you had to
wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the
victuals though there warnt really anything the matter with themthat
is nothing only everything was cooked by itself  In a barrel of odds
and ends it is different things get mixed up and the juice kind of
swaps around and the things go better

After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the
Bulrushers and I was in a sweat to find out all about him but by and by
she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time so then
I didnt care no more about him because I dont take no stock in dead
people

Pretty soon I wanted to smoke and asked the widow to let me  But she
wouldnt  She said it was a mean practice and wasnt clean and I must
try to not do it any more  That is just the way with some people  They
get down on a thing when they dont know nothing about it  Here she was
abothering about Moses which was no kin to her and no use to anybody
being gone you see yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a
thing that had some good in it  And she took snuff too of course that
was all right because she done it herself

Her sister Miss Watson a tolerable slim old maid with goggles on
had just come to live with her and took a set at me now with a
spellingbook She worked me middling hard for about an hour and then
the widow made her ease up  I couldnt stood it much longer  Then for
an hour it was deadly dull and I was fidgety  Miss Watson would say
Dont put your feet up there Huckleberry and Dont scrunch up like
that Huckleberryset up straight and pretty soon she would say
Dont gap and stretch like that Huckleberrywhy dont you try to
behave  Then she told me all about the bad place and I said I wished I
was there She got mad then but I didnt mean no harm  All I wanted was
to go somewheres all I wanted was a change I warnt particular  She
said it was wicked to say what I said said she wouldnt say it for the
whole world she was going to live so as to go to the good place  Well
I couldnt see no advantage in going where she was going so I made up my
mind I wouldnt try for it  But I never said so because it would only
make trouble and wouldnt do no good

Now she had got a start and she went on and told me all about the good
place  She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all
day long with a harp and sing forever and ever  So I didnt think much
of it But I never said so  I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would
go there and she said not by a considerable sight  I was glad about
that because I wanted him and me to be together

Miss Watson she kept pecking at me and it got tiresome and lonesome  By
and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers and then everybody
was off to bed  I went up to my room with a piece of candle and put it
on the table  Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to
think of something cheerful but it warnt no use  I felt so lonesome I
most wished I was dead  The stars were shining and the leaves rustled
in the woods ever so mournful and I heard an owl away off whowhooing
about somebody that was dead and a whippowill and a dog crying about
somebody that was going to die and the wind was trying to whisper
something to me and I couldnt make out what it was and so it made the
cold shivers run over me Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of
a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something thats
on its mind and cant make itself understood and so cant rest easy in
its grave and has to go about that way every night grieving  I got so
downhearted and scared I did wish I had some company  Pretty soon a
spider went crawling up my shoulder and I flipped it off and it lit in
the candle and before I could budge it was all shriveled up  I didnt
need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch
me some bad luck so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me
I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast
every time and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to
keep witches away  But I hadnt no confidence  You do that when youve
lost a horseshoe that youve found instead of nailing it up over the
door but I hadnt ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad
luck when youd killed a spider

I set down again ashaking all over and got out my pipe for a smoke
for the house was all as still as death now and so the widow wouldnt
know Well after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go
boomboomboomtwelve licks and all still againstiller than ever
Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees
something was a stirring  I set still and listened  Directly I could
just barely hear a meyow meyow down there  That was good  Says I
meyow meyow as soft as I could and then I put out the light and
scrambled out of the window on to the shed  Then I slipped down to the
ground and crawled in among the trees and sure enough there was Tom
Sawyer waiting for me




CHAPTER II

WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of
the widows garden stooping down so as the branches wouldnt scrape our
heads When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a
noise  We scrouched down and laid still  Miss Watsons big nigger
named Jim was setting in the kitchen door we could see him pretty
clear because there was a light behind him  He got up and stretched his
neck out about a minute listening  Then he says

Who dah

He listened some more then he come tiptoeing down and stood right
between us we could a touched him nearly  Well likely it was minutes
and minutes that there warnt a sound and we all there so close
together  There was a place on my ankle that got to itching but I
dasnt scratch it and then my ear begun to itch and next my back right
between my shoulders  Seemed like Id die if I couldnt scratch  Well
Ive noticed that thing plenty times since  If you are with the quality
or at a funeral or trying to go to sleep when you aint sleepyif you
are anywheres where it wont do for you to scratch why you will itch all
over in upwards of a thousand places Pretty soon Jim says

Say who is you  Whar is you  Dog my cats ef I didn hear sumfn
Well I know what Is gwyne to do  Is gwyne to set down here and listen
tell I hears it agin

So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom  He leaned his back up
against a tree and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched
one of mine  My nose begun to itch  It itched till the tears come into
my eyes  But I dasnt scratch  Then it begun to itch on the inside
Next I got to itching underneath  I didnt know how I was going to set
still This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes but it
seemed a sight longer than that  I was itching in eleven different
places now  I reckoned I couldnt stand it moren a minute longer but I
set my teeth hard and got ready to try  Just then Jim begun to breathe
heavy next he begun to snoreand then I was pretty soon comfortable
again

Tom he made a sign to mekind of a little noise with his mouthand we
went creeping away on our hands and knees  When we was ten foot off Tom
whispered to me and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun  But I said
no he might wake and make a disturbance and then theyd find out I
warnt in Then Tom said he hadnt got candles enough and he would slip
in the kitchen and get some more  I didnt want him to try  I said Jim
might wake up and come  But Tom wanted to resk it so we slid in there
and got three candles and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay
Then we got out and I was in a sweat to get away but nothing would do
Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was on his hands and knees and play
something on him  I waited and it seemed a good while everything was
so still and lonesome

As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path around the garden fence
and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of
the house  Tom said he slipped Jims hat off of his head and hung it on
a limb right over him and Jim stirred a little but he didnt wake
Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance
and rode him all over the State and then set him under the trees again
and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it  And next time Jim told
it he said they rode him down to New Orleans and after that every time
he told it he spread it more and more till by and by he said they rode
him all over the world and tired him most to death and his back was all
over saddleboils  Jim was monstrous proud about it and he got so he
wouldnt hardly notice the other niggers  Niggers would come miles to
hear Jim tell about it and he was more looked up to than any nigger in
that country  Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and
look him all over same as if he was a wonder  Niggers is always talking
about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire but whenever one was
talking and letting on to know all about such things Jim would happen in
and say Hm  What you know bout witches and that nigger was corked
up and had to take a back seat  Jim always kept that fivecenter piece
round his neck with a string and said it was a charm the devil give to
him with his own hands and told him he could cure anybody with it and
fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it but
he never told what it was he said to it  Niggers would come from all
around there and give Jim anything they had just for a sight of that
fivecenter piece but they wouldnt touch it because the devil had had
his hands on it  Jim was most ruined for a servant because he got stuck
up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches

Well when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down
into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling where
there was sick folks maybe and the stars over us was sparkling ever so
fine and down by the village was the river a whole mile broad and
awful still and grand  We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben
Rogers and two or three more of the boys hid in the old tanyard  So we
unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half to the
big scar on the hillside and went ashore

We went to a clump of bushes and Tom made everybody swear to keep the
secret and then showed them a hole in the hill right in the thickest
part of the bushes  Then we lit the candles and crawled in on our hands
and knees  We went about two hundred yards and then the cave opened up
Tom poked about amongst the passages and pretty soon ducked under a wall
where you wouldnt a noticed that there was a hole  We went along a
narrow place and got into a kind of room all damp and sweaty and cold
and there we stopped  Tom says

Now well start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyers Gang
Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath and write his name
in blood

Everybody was willing  So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote
the oath on and read it  It swore every boy to stick to the band and
never tell any of the secrets and if anybody done anything to any boy in
the band whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family
must do it and he mustnt eat and he mustnt sleep till he had killed
them and hacked a cross in their breasts which was the sign of the band
And nobody that didnt belong to the band could use that mark and if he
did he must be sued and if he done it again he must be killed  And if
anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets he must have his
throat cut and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered
all around and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never
mentioned again by the gang but have a curse put on it and be forgot
forever

Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath and asked Tom if he got it
out of his own head  He said some of it but the rest was out of
piratebooks and robberbooks and every gang that was hightoned had it

Some thought it would be good to kill the FAMILIES of boys that told the
secrets  Tom said it was a good idea so he took a pencil and wrote it
in Then Ben Rogers says

Heres Huck Finn he haint got no family what you going to do bout
him

Well haint he got a father says Tom Sawyer

Yes hes got a father but you cant never find him these days  He
used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard but he haint been seen
in these parts for a year or more

They talked it over and they was going to rule me out because they said
every boy must have a family or somebody to kill or else it wouldnt be
fair and square for the others  Well nobody could think of anything to
doeverybody was stumped and set still  I was most ready to cry but
all at once I thought of a way and so I offered them Miss Watsonthey
could kill her  Everybody said

Oh shell do  Thats all right  Huck can come in

Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with and
I made my mark on the paper

Now says Ben Rogers whats the line of business of this Gang

Nothing only robbery and murder Tom said

But who are we going to robhouses or cattle or

Stuff stealing cattle and such things aint robbery its burglary
says Tom Sawyer  We aint burglars  That aint no sort of style  We
are highwaymen  We stop stages and carriages on the road with masks on
and kill the people and take their watches and money

Must we always kill the people

Oh certainly  Its best  Some authorities think different but mostly
its considered best to kill themexcept some that you bring to the cave
here and keep them till theyre ransomed

Ransomed  Whats that

I dont know  But thats what they do  Ive seen it in books and so
of course thats what weve got to do

But how can we do it if we dont know what it is

Why blame it all weve GOT to do it  Dont I tell you its in the
books  Do you want to go to doing different from whats in the books
and get things all muddled up

Oh thats all very fine to SAY Tom Sawyer but how in the nation are
these fellows going to be ransomed if we dont know how to do it to them
thats the thing I want to get at  Now what do you reckon it is

Well I dont know  But peraps if we keep them till theyre ransomed
it means that we keep them till theyre dead

Now thats something LIKE  Thatll answer  Why couldnt you said that
before  Well keep them till theyre ransomed to death and a bothersome
lot theyll be tooeating up everything and always trying to get
loose

How you talk Ben Rogers  How can they get loose when theres a guard
over them ready to shoot them down if they move a peg

A guard  Well that IS good  So somebodys got to set up all night and
never get any sleep just so as to watch them  I think thats
foolishness Why cant a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they
get here

Because it aint in the books sothats why  Now Ben Rogers do you
want to do things regular or dont youthats the idea  Dont you
reckon that the people that made the books knows whats the correct thing
to do  Do you reckon YOU can learn em anything  Not by a good deal
No sir well just go on and ransom them in the regular way

All right  I dont mind but I say its a fool way anyhow  Say do we
kill the women too

Well Ben Rogers if I was as ignorant as you I wouldnt let on  Kill
the women  No nobody ever saw anything in the books like that  You
fetch them to the cave and youre always as polite as pie to them and
by and by they fall in love with you and never want to go home any
more

Well if thats the way Im agreed but I dont take no stock in it
Mighty soon well have the cave so cluttered up with women and fellows
waiting to be ransomed that there wont be no place for the robbers
But go ahead I aint got nothing to say

Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now and when they waked him up he was
scared and cried and said he wanted to go home to his ma and didnt
want to be a robber any more

So they all made fun of him and called him crybaby and that made him
mad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets  But Tom
give him five cents to keep quiet and said we would all go home and meet
next week and rob somebody and kill some people

Ben Rogers said he couldnt get out much only Sundays and so he wanted
to begin next Sunday but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it
on Sunday and that settled the thing  They agreed to get together and
fix a day as soon as they could and then we elected Tom Sawyer first
captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang and so started home

I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was
breaking My new clothes was all greased up and clayey and I was
dogtired




CHAPTER III

WELL I got a good goingover in the morning from old Miss Watson on
account of my clothes but the widow she didnt scold but only cleaned
off the grease and clay and looked so sorry that I thought I would
behave awhile if I could  Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and
prayed but nothing come of it  She told me to pray every day and
whatever I asked for I would get it  But it warnt so  I tried it
Once I got a fishline but no hooks  It warnt any good to me without
hooks  I tried for the hooks three or four times but somehow I couldnt
make it work  By and by one day I asked Miss Watson to try for me but
she said I was a fool  She never told me why and I couldnt make it out
no way

I set down one time back in the woods and had a long think about it  I
says to myself if a body can get anything they pray for why dont
Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork  Why cant the widow get
back her silver snuffbox that was stole  Why cant Miss Watson fat up
No says I to my self there aint nothing in it  I went and told the
widow about it and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it
was spiritual gifts  This was too many for me but she told me what
she meantI must help other people and do everything I could for other
people and look out for them all the time and never think about myself
This was including Miss Watson as I took it  I went out in the woods
and turned it over in my mind a long time but I couldnt see no
advantage about itexcept for the other people so at last I reckoned I
wouldnt worry about it any more but just let it go  Sometimes the
widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a
bodys mouth water but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and
knock it all down again  I judged I could see that there was two
Providences and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the
widows Providence but if Miss Watsons got him there warnt no help for
him any more  I thought it all out and reckoned I would belong to the
widows if he wanted me though I couldnt make out how he was agoing to
be any better off then than what he was before seeing I was so ignorant
and so kind of lowdown and ornery

Pap he hadnt been seen for more than a year and that was comfortable
for me I didnt want to see him no more  He used to always whale me
when he was sober and could get his hands on me though I used to take to
the woods most of the time when he was around  Well about this time he
was found in the river drownded about twelve mile above town so people
said  They judged it was him anyway said this drownded man was just
his size and was ragged and had uncommon long hair which was all like
pap but they couldnt make nothing out of the face because it had been
in the water so long it warnt much like a face at all  They said he was
floating on his back in the water  They took him and buried him on the
bank  But I warnt comfortable long because I happened to think of
something  I knowed mighty well that a drownded man dont float on his
back but on his face  So I knowed then that this warnt pap but a
woman dressed up in a mans clothes  So I was uncomfortable again  I
judged the old man would turn up again by and by though I wished he
wouldnt

We played robber now and then about a month and then I resigned  All
the boys did  We hadnt robbed nobody hadnt killed any people but
only just pretended  We used to hop out of the woods and go charging
down on hogdrivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market but
we never hived any of them  Tom Sawyer called the hogs ingots and he
called the turnips and stuff julery and we would go to the cave and
powwow over what we had done and how many people we had killed and
marked  But I couldnt see no profit in it  One time Tom sent a boy to
run about town with a blazing stick which he called a slogan which was
the sign for the Gang to get together and then he said he had got
secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish
merchants and rich Arabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two
hundred elephants and six hundred camels and over a thousand sumter
mules all loaded down with dimonds and they didnt have only a guard
of four hundred soldiers and so we would lay in ambuscade as he called
it and kill the lot and scoop the things  He said we must slick up our
swords and guns and get ready  He never could go after even a
turnipcart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it
though they was only lath and broomsticks and you might scour at them
till you rotted and then they warnt worth a mouthful of ashes more than
what they was before  I didnt believe we could lick such a crowd of
Spaniards and Arabs but I wanted to see the camels and elephants so I
was on hand next day Saturday in the ambuscade and when we got the
word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill  But there warnt no
Spaniards and Arabs and there warnt no camels nor no elephants  It
warnt anything but a Sundayschool picnic and only a primerclass at
that  We busted it up and chased the children up the hollow but we
never got anything but some doughnuts and jam though Ben Rogers got a
rag doll and Jo Harper got a hymnbook and a tract and then the teacher
charged in and made us drop everything and cut  I didnt see no
dimonds and I told Tom Sawyer so  He said there was loads of them
there anyway and he said there was Arabs there too and elephants and
things  I said why couldnt we see them then  He said if I warnt so
ignorant but had read a book called Don Quixote I would know without
asking  He said it was all done by enchantment  He said there was
hundreds of soldiers there and elephants and treasure and so on but we
had enemies which he called magicians and they had turned the whole
thing into an infant Sundayschool just out of spite  I said all
right then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians  Tom
Sawyer said I was a numskull

Why said he a magician could call up a lot of genies and they would
hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson  They are as
tall as a tree and as big around as a church

Well I says spose we got some genies to help UScant we lick the
other crowd then

How you going to get them

I dont know  How do THEY get them

Why they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring and then the genies come
tearing in with the thunder and lightning aripping around and the smoke
arolling and everything theyre told to do they up and do it  They
dont think nothing of pulling a shottower up by the roots and belting
a Sundayschool superintendent over the head with itor any other man

Who makes them tear around so

Why whoever rubs the lamp or the ring  They belong to whoever rubs the
lamp or the ring and theyve got to do whatever he says  If he tells
them to build a palace forty miles long out of dimonds and fill it full
of chewinggum or whatever you want and fetch an emperors daughter
from China for you to marry theyve got to do itand theyve got to do
it before sunup next morning too  And more  theyve got to waltz that
palace around over the country wherever you want it you understand

Well says I I think they are a pack of flatheads for not keeping
the palace themselves stead of fooling them away like that  And whats
moreif I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would
drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp

How you talk Huck Finn  Why youd HAVE to come when he rubbed it
whether you wanted to or not

What and I as high as a tree and as big as a church  All right then
I WOULD come but I lay Id make that man climb the highest tree there
was in the country

Shucks it aint no use to talk to you Huck Finn  You dont seem to
know anything somehowperfect saphead

I thought all this over for two or three days and then I reckoned I
would see if there was anything in it  I got an old tin lamp and an iron
ring and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like
an Injun calculating to build a palace and sell it but it warnt no
use none of the genies come  So then I judged that all that stuff was
only just one of Tom Sawyers lies  I reckoned he believed in the Arabs
and the elephants but as for me I think different  It had all the marks
of a Sundayschool




CHAPTER IV

WELL three or four months run along and it was well into the winter
now I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and
write just a little and could say the multiplication table up to six
times seven is thirtyfive and I dont reckon I could ever get any
further than that if I was to live forever  I dont take no stock in
mathematics anyway

At first I hated the school but by and by I got so I could stand it
Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey and the hiding I got next
day done me good and cheered me up  So the longer I went to school the
easier it got to be  I was getting sort of used to the widows ways
too and they warnt so raspy on me  Living in a house and sleeping in a
bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly but before the cold weather I used
to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes and so that was a rest to
me  I liked the old ways best but I was getting so I liked the new
ones too a little bit The widow said I was coming along slow but sure
and doing very satisfactory  She said she warnt ashamed of me

One morning I happened to turn over the saltcellar at breakfast  I
reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder
and keep off the bad luck but Miss Watson was in ahead of me and
crossed me off She says Take your hands away Huckleberry what a mess
you are always making  The widow put in a good word for me but that
warnt going to keep off the bad luck I knowed that well enough  I
started out after breakfast feeling worried and shaky and wondering
where it was going to fall on me and what it was going to be  There is
ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck but this wasnt one of them
kind so I never tried to do anything but just poked along lowspirited
and on the watchout

I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go
through the high board fence  There was an inch of new snow on the
ground and I seen somebodys tracks  They had come up from the quarry
and stood around the stile a while and then went on around the garden
fence  It was funny they hadnt come in after standing around so  I
couldnt make it out  It was very curious somehow  I was going to
follow around but I stooped down to look at the tracks first  I didnt
notice anything at first but next I did  There was a cross in the left
bootheel made with big nails to keep off the devil

I was up in a second and shinning down the hill  I looked over my
shoulder every now and then but I didnt see nobody  I was at Judge
Thatchers as quick as I could get there  He said

Why my boy you are all out of breath  Did you come for your
interest

No sir I says is there some for me

Oh yes a halfyearly is in last nightover a hundred and fifty
dollars  Quite a fortune for you  You had better let me invest it along
with your six thousand because if you take it youll spend it

No sir I says I dont want to spend it  I dont want it at all
nor the six thousand nuther  I want you to take it I want to give it
to youthe six thousand and all

He looked surprised  He couldnt seem to make it out  He says

Why what can you mean my boy

I says Dont you ask me no questions about it please  Youll take it
wont you

He says

Well Im puzzled  Is something the matter

Please take it says I and dont ask me nothingthen I wont have to
tell no lies

He studied a while and then he says

Ohoo  I think I see  You want to SELL all your property to menot
give it  Thats the correct idea

Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over and says

There you see it says for a consideration  That means I have bought
it of you and paid you for it  Heres a dollar for you  Now you sign
it

So I signed it and left

Miss Watsons nigger Jim had a hairball as big as your fist which had
been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox and he used to do magic
with it  He said there was a spirit inside of it and it knowed
everything  So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again
for I found his tracks in the snow  What I wanted to know was what he
was going to do and was he going to stay  Jim got out his hairball and
said something over it and then he held it up and dropped it on the
floor  It fell pretty solid and only rolled about an inch  Jim tried
it again and then another time and it acted just the same  Jim got
down on his knees and put his ear against it and listened  But it
warnt no use he said it wouldnt talk He said sometimes it wouldnt
talk without money  I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter
that warnt no good because the brass showed through the silver a little
and it wouldnt pass nohow even if the brass didnt show because it was
so slick it felt greasy and so that would tell on it every time  I
reckoned I wouldnt say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge I
said it was pretty bad money but maybe the hairball would take it
because maybe it wouldnt know the difference  Jim smelt it and bit it
and rubbed it and said he would manage so the hairball would think it
was good  He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the
quarter in between and keep it there all night and next morning you
couldnt see no brass and it wouldnt feel greasy no more and so
anybody in town would take it in a minute let alone a hairball  Well
I knowed a potato would do that before but I had forgot it

Jim put the quarter under the hairball and got down and listened again
This time he said the hairball was all right  He said it would tell my
whole fortune if I wanted it to  I says go on  So the hairball talked
to Jim and Jim told it to me  He says

Yo ole father doan know yit what hes agwyne to do  Sometimes he
spec hell go way en den agin he spec hell stay  De bes way is to
res easy en let de ole man take his own way  Deys two angels hoverin

When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat paphis
own self




CHAPTER V

I HAD shut the door to  Then I turned around and there he was  I used
to be scared of him all the time he tanned me so much  I reckoned I was
scared now too but in a minute I see I was mistakenthat is after the
first jolt as you may say when my breath sort of hitched he being so
unexpected but right away after I see I warnt scared of him worth
bothring about

He was most fifty and he looked it  His hair was long and tangled and
greasy and hung down and you could see his eyes shining through like he
was behind vines  It was all black no gray so was his long mixedup
whiskers  There warnt no color in his face where his face showed it
was white not like another mans white but a white to make a body sick
a white to make a bodys flesh crawla treetoad white a fishbelly
white  As for his clothesjust rags that was all  He had one ankle
resting on tother knee the boot on that foot was busted and two of his
toes stuck through and he worked them now and then  His hat was laying
on the flooran old black slouch with the top caved in like a lid

I stood alooking at him he set there alooking at me with his chair
tilted back a little  I set the candle down  I noticed the window was
up so he had clumb in by the shed  He kept alooking me all over  By
and by he says

Starchy clothesvery  You think youre a good deal of a bigbug DONT

Maybe I am maybe I aint I says

Dont you give me none o your lip says he  Youve put on
considerable many frills since I been away  Ill take you down a peg
before I get done with you  Youre educated too they saycan read and
write  You think youre bettern your father now dont you because he
cant  ILL take it out of you  Who told you you might meddle with such
hifalutn foolishness heywho told you you could

The widow  She told me

The widow heyand who told the widow she could put in her shovel
about a thing that aint none of her business

Nobody never told her

Well Ill learn her how to meddle  And looky hereyou drop that
school you hear  Ill learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs
over his own father and let on to be bettern what HE is  You lemme
catch you fooling around that school again you hear  Your mother
couldnt read and she couldnt write nuther before she died  None of
the family couldnt before THEY died  I cant and here youre
aswelling yourself up like this  I aint the man to stand ityou hear
Say lemme hear you read

I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the
wars When Id read about a half a minute he fetched the book a whack
with his hand and knocked it across the house  He says

Its so  You can do it  I had my doubts when you told me  Now looky
here you stop that putting on frills  I wont have it  Ill lay for
you my smarty and if I catch you about that school Ill tan you good
First you know youll get religion too  I never see such a son

He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy and
says

Whats this

Its something they give me for learning my lessons good

He tore it up and says

Ill give you something betterIll give you a cowhide

He set there amumbling and agrowling a minute and then he says

AINT you a sweetscented dandy though  A bed and bedclothes and a
looknglass and a piece of carpet on the floorand your own father
got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard  I never see such a son  I
bet Ill take some o these frills out o you before Im done with you
Why there aint no end to your airsthey say youre rich  Heyhows
that

They liethats how

Looky heremind how you talk to me Im astanding about all I can
stand nowso dont gimme no sass  Ive been in town two days and I
haint heard nothing but about you bein rich  I heard about it away
down the river too  Thats why I come  You git me that money
tomorrowI want it

I haint got no money

Its a lie  Judge Thatchers got it  You git it  I want it

I haint got no money I tell you  You ask Judge Thatcher hell tell
you the same

All right  Ill ask him and Ill make him pungle too or Ill know
the reason why  Say how much you got in your pocket  I want it

I haint got only a dollar and I want that to

It dont make no difference what you want it foryou just shell it
out

He took it and bit it to see if it was good and then he said he was
going down town to get some whisky said he hadnt had a drink all day
When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again and cussed me
for putting on frills and trying to be better than him and when I
reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again and told me
to mind about that school because he was going to lay for me and lick me
if I didnt drop that

Next day he was drunk and he went to Judge Thatchers and bullyragged
him and tried to make him give up the money but he couldnt and then
he swore hed make the law force him

The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from
him and let one of them be my guardian but it was a new judge that had
just come and he didnt know the old man so he said courts mustnt
interfere and separate families if they could help it said hed druther
not take a child away from its father  So Judge Thatcher and the widow
had to quit on the business

That pleased the old man till he couldnt rest  He said hed cowhide me
till I was black and blue if I didnt raise some money for him  I
borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher and pap took it and got
drunk and went ablowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying
on and he kept it up all over town with a tin pan till most midnight
then they jailed him and next day they had him before court and jailed
him again for a week  But he said HE was satisfied said he was boss of
his son and hed make it warm for HIM

When he got out the new judge said he was agoing to make a man of him
So he took him to his own house and dressed him up clean and nice and
had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family and was just
old pie to him so to speak  And after supper he talked to him about
temperance and such things till the old man cried and said hed been a
fool and fooled away his life but now he was agoing to turn over a new
leaf and be a man nobody wouldnt be ashamed of and he hoped the judge
would help him and not look down on him  The judge said he could hug him
for them words so he cried and his wife she cried again pap said hed
been a man that had always been misunderstood before and the judge said
he believed it  The old man said that what a man wanted that was down
was sympathy and the judge said it was so so they cried again  And
when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand and says

Look at it gentlemen and ladies all take ahold of it shake it
Theres a hand that was the hand of a hog but it aint so no more its
the hand of a man thats started in on a new life andll die before
hell go back  You mark them wordsdont forget I said them  Its a
clean hand now shake itdont be afeard

So they shook it one after the other all around and cried  The
judges wife she kissed it  Then the old man he signed a pledgemade
his mark The judge said it was the holiest time on record or something
like that Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room which was
the spare room and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and
clumb out on to the porchroof and slid down a stanchion and traded his
new coat for a jug of fortyrod and clumb back again and had a good old
time and towards daylight he crawled out again drunk as a fiddler and
rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places and was most
froze to death when somebody found him after sunup  And when they come
to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could
navigate it

The judge he felt kind of sore  He said he reckoned a body could reform
the old man with a shotgun maybe but he didnt know no other way




CHAPTER VI

WELL pretty soon the old man was up and around again and then he went
for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money and he
went for me too for not stopping school  He catched me a couple of
times and thrashed me but I went to school just the same and dodged him
or outrun him most of the time  I didnt want to go to school much
before but I reckoned Id go now to spite pap  That law trial was a
slow businessappeared like they warnt ever going to get started on
it so every now and then Id borrow two or three dollars off of the
judge for him to keep from getting a cowhiding  Every time he got money
he got drunk and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town and
every time he raised Cain he got jailed  He was just suitedthis kind
of thing was right in his line

He got to hanging around the widows too much and so she told him at last
that if he didnt quit using around there she would make trouble for him
Well WASNT he mad  He said he would show who was Huck Finns boss  So
he watched out for me one day in the spring and catched me and took me
up the river about three mile in a skiff and crossed over to the
Illinois shore where it was woody and there warnt no houses but an old
log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you couldnt find it if
you didnt know where it was

He kept me with him all the time and I never got a chance to run off
We lived in that old cabin and he always locked the door and put the key
under his head nights  He had a gun which he had stole I reckon and we
fished and hunted and that was what we lived on  Every little while he
locked me in and went down to the store three miles to the ferry and
traded fish and game for whisky and fetched it home and got drunk and
had a good time and licked me  The widow she found out where I was by
and by and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me but pap drove
him off with the gun and it warnt long after that till I was used to
being where I was and liked itall but the cowhide part

It was kind of lazy and jolly laying off comfortable all day smoking
and fishing and no books nor study  Two months or more run along and
my clothes got to be all rags and dirt and I didnt see how Id ever got
to like it so well at the widows where you had to wash and eat on a
plate and comb up and go to bed and get up regular and be forever
bothering over a book and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the
time  I didnt want to go back no more  I had stopped cussing because
the widow didnt like it but now I took to it again because pap hadnt
no objections  It was pretty good times up in the woods there take it
all around

But by and by pap got too handy with his hickry and I couldnt stand
it I was all over welts  He got to going away so much too and locking
me in  Once he locked me in and was gone three days  It was dreadful
lonesome  I judged he had got drowned and I wasnt ever going to get
out any more  I was scared  I made up my mind I would fix up some way
to leave there  I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time but I
couldnt find no way  There warnt a window to it big enough for a dog
to get through  I couldnt get up the chimbly it was too narrow  The
door was thick solid oak slabs  Pap was pretty careful not to leave a
knife or anything in the cabin when he was away I reckon I had hunted
the place over as much as a hundred times well I was most all the time
at it because it was about the only way to put in the time  But this
time I found something at last I found an old rusty woodsaw without any
handle it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof
I greased it up and went to work  There was an old horseblanket nailed
against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table to keep
the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out  I
got under the table and raised the blanket and went to work to saw a
section of the big bottom log outbig enough to let me through  Well
it was a good long job but I was getting towards the end of it when I
heard paps gun in the woods  I got rid of the signs of my work and
dropped the blanket and hid my saw and pretty soon pap come in

Pap warnt in a good humorso he was his natural self  He said he was
down town and everything was going wrong  His lawyer said he reckoned
he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on
the trial but then there was ways to put it off a long time and Judge
Thatcher knowed how to do it  And he said people allowed thered be
another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my
guardian and they guessed it would win this time  This shook me up
considerable because I didnt want to go back to the widows any more
and be so cramped up and sivilized as they called it  Then the old man
got to cussing and cussed everything and everybody he could think of
and then cussed them all over again to make sure he hadnt skipped any
and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round
including a considerable parcel of people which he didnt know the names
of and so called them whatshisname when he got to them and went
right along with his cussing

He said he would like to see the widow get me  He said he would watch
out and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place
six or seven mile off to stow me in where they might hunt till they
dropped and they couldnt find me  That made me pretty uneasy again but
only for a minute I reckoned I wouldnt stay on hand till he got that
chance

The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got
There was a fiftypound sack of corn meal and a side of bacon
ammunition and a fourgallon jug of whisky and an old book and two
newspapers for wadding besides some tow  I toted up a load and went
back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest  I thought it all
over and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines and
take to the woods when I run away  I guessed I wouldnt stay in one
place but just tramp right across the country mostly night times and
hunt and fish to keep alive and so get so far away that the old man nor
the widow couldnt ever find me any more  I judged I would saw out and
leave that night if pap got drunk enough and I reckoned he would  I got
so full of it I didnt notice how long I was staying till the old man
hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded

I got the things all up to the cabin and then it was about dark  While
I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of
warmed up and went to ripping again  He had been drunk over in town
and laid in the gutter all night and he was a sight to look at  A body
would a thought he was Adamhe was just all mud  Whenever his liquor
begun to work he most always went for the govment this time he says

Call this a govment why just look at it and see what its like
Heres the law astanding ready to take a mans son away from hima
mans own son which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and
all the expense of raising  Yes just as that man has got that son
raised at last and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin for HIM
and give him a rest the law up and goes for him  And they call THAT
govment  That aint all nuther  The law backs that old Judge Thatcher
up and helps him to keep me out o my property  Heres what the law
does  The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and upards and
jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this and lets him go round in
clothes that aint fitten for a hog They call that govment  A man cant
get his rights in a govment like this Sometimes Ive a mighty notion to
just leave the country for good and all Yes and I TOLD em so I told
old Thatcher so to his face  Lots of em heard me and can tell what I
said  Says I for two cents Id leave the blamed country and never come
anear it agin  Thems the very words  I says look at my hatif you
call it a hatbut the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till
its below my chin and then it aint rightly a hat at all but more like
my head was shoved up through a jint o stovepipe  Look at it says I
such a hat for me to wearone of the wealthiest men in this town if I
could git my rights

Oh yes this is a wonderful govment wonderful  Why looky here
There was a free nigger there from Ohioa mulatter most as white as a
white man  He had the whitest shirt on you ever see too and the
shiniest hat and there aint a man in that town thats got as fine
clothes as what he had and he had a gold watch and chain and a
silverheaded canethe awfulest old grayheaded nabob in the State  And
what do you think  They said he was a pfessor in a college and could
talk all kinds of languages and knowed everything  And that aint the
wust They said he could VOTE when he was at home  Well that let me
out Thinks I what is the country acoming to  It was lection day and
I was just about to go and vote myself if I warnt too drunk to get
there but when they told me there was a State in this country where
theyd let that nigger vote I drawed out  I says Ill never vote agin
Thems the very words I said they all heard me and the country may rot
for all meIll never vote agin as long as I live  And to see the cool
way of that niggerwhy he wouldnt a give me the road if I hadnt
shoved him out o the way  I says to the people why aint this nigger
put up at auction and soldthats what I want to know  And what do you
reckon they said Why they said he couldnt be sold till hed been in
the State six months and he hadnt been there that long yet  There
nowthats a specimen  They call that a govment that cant sell a free
nigger till hes been in the State six months  Heres a govment that
calls itself a govment and lets on to be a govment and thinks it is a
govment and yets got to set stockstill for six whole months before it
can take a hold of a prowling thieving infernal whiteshirted free
nigger and

Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was
taking him to so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and
barked both shins and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of
languagemostly hove at the nigger and the govment though he give the
tub some too all along here and there  He hopped around the cabin
considerable first on one leg and then on the other holding first one
shin and then the other one and at last he let out with his left foot
all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick  But it warnt good
judgment because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking
out of the front end of it so now he raised a howl that fairly made a
bodys hair raise and down he went in the dirt and rolled there and
held his toes and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had
ever done previous  He said so his own self afterwards  He had heard
old Sowberry Hagan in his best days and he said it laid over him too
but I reckon that was sort of piling it on maybe

After supper pap took the jug and said he had enough whisky there for
two drunks and one delirium tremens  That was always his word  I judged
he would be blind drunk in about an hour and then I would steal the key
or saw myself out one or tother  He drank and drank and tumbled down
on his blankets by and by but luck didnt run my way  He didnt go
sound asleep but was uneasy  He groaned and moaned and thrashed around
this way and that for a long time  At last I got so sleepy I couldnt
keep my eyes open all I could do and so before I knowed what I was about
I was sound asleep and the candle burning

I dont know how long I was asleep but all of a sudden there was an
awful scream and I was up  There was pap looking wild and skipping
around every which way and yelling about snakes  He said they was
crawling up his legs and then he would give a jump and scream and say
one had bit him on the cheekbut I couldnt see no snakes  He started
and run round and round the cabin hollering Take him off take him off
hes biting me on the neck  I never see a man look so wild in the eyes
Pretty soon he was all fagged out and fell down panting then he rolled
over and over wonderful fast kicking things every which way and
striking and grabbing at the air with his hands and screaming and saying
there was devils ahold of him  He wore out by and by and laid still a
while moaning  Then he laid stiller and didnt make a sound  I could
hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods and it seemed
terrible still  He was laying over by the corner By and by he raised up
part way and listened with his head to one side  He says very low

Tramptramptramp thats the dead tramptramptramp theyre
coming after me but I wont go  Oh theyre here dont touch me
dont hands offtheyre cold let go  Oh let a poor devil alone

Then he went down on all fours and crawled off begging them to let him
alone and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the
old pine table still abegging and then he went to crying  I could
hear him through the blanket

By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild and he
see me and went for me  He chased me round and round the place with a
claspknife calling me the Angel of Death and saying he would kill me
and then I couldnt come for him no more  I begged and told him I was
only Huck but he laughed SUCH a screechy laugh and roared and cussed
and kept on chasing me up  Once when I turned short and dodged under his
arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders and I
thought I was gone but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning and
saved myself Pretty soon he was all tired out and dropped down with his
back against the door and said he would rest a minute and then kill me
He put his knife under him and said he would sleep and get strong and
then he would see who was who

So he dozed off pretty soon  By and by I got the old splitbottom chair
and clumb up as easy as I could not to make any noise and got down the
gun  I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded then I
laid it across the turnip barrel pointing towards pap and set down
behind it to wait for him to stir  And how slow and still the time did
drag along




CHAPTER VII

GIT up  What you bout

I opened my eyes and looked around trying to make out where I was  It
was after sunup and I had been sound asleep  Pap was standing over me
looking sour and sick too  He says

What you doin with this gun

I judged he didnt know nothing about what he had been doing so I says

Somebody tried to get in so I was laying for him

Why didnt you roust me out

Well I tried to but I couldnt I couldnt budge you

Well all right  Dont stand there palavering all day but out with you
and see if theres a fish on the lines for breakfast  Ill be along in a
minute

He unlocked the door and I cleared out up the riverbank  I noticed
some pieces of limbs and such things floating down and a sprinkling of
bark so I knowed the river had begun to rise  I reckoned I would have
great times now if I was over at the town  The June rise used to be
always luck for me because as soon as that rise begins here comes
cordwood floating down and pieces of log raftssometimes a dozen logs
together so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the
woodyards and the sawmill

I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and tother one out for
what the rise might fetch along  Well all at once here comes a canoe
just a beauty too about thirteen or fourteen foot long riding high
like a duck  I shot headfirst off of the bank like a frog clothes and
all on and struck out for the canoe  I just expected thered be
somebody laying down in it because people often done that to fool folks
and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it theyd raise up and
laugh at him  But it warnt so this time  It was a driftcanoe sure
enough and I clumb in and paddled her ashore  Thinks I the old man
will be glad when he sees thisshes worth ten dollars  But when I
got to shore pap wasnt in sight yet and as I was running her into a
little creek like a gully all hung over with vines and willows I struck
another idea  I judged Id hide her good and then stead of taking to
the woods when I run off Id go down the river about fifty mile and camp
in one place for good and not have such a rough time tramping on foot

It was pretty close to the shanty and I thought I heard the old man
coming all the time but I got her hid and then I out and looked around
a bunch of willows and there was the old man down the path a piece just
drawing a bead on a bird with his gun  So he hadnt seen anything

When he got along I was hard at it taking up a trot line  He abused me
a little for being so slow but I told him I fell in the river and that
was what made me so long  I knowed he would see I was wet and then he
would be asking questions  We got five catfish off the lines and went
home

While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up both of us being about
wore out I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap
and the widow from trying to follow me it would be a certainer thing
than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me you
see all kinds of things might happen  Well I didnt see no way for a
while but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of
water and he says

Another time a man comes aprowling round here you roust me out you
hear That man warnt here for no good  Id a shot him  Next time you
roust me out you hear

Then he dropped down and went to sleep again but what he had been saying
give me the very idea I wanted  I says to myself I can fix it now so
nobody wont think of following me

About twelve oclock we turned out and went along up the bank  The river
was coming up pretty fast and lots of driftwood going by on the rise
By and by along comes part of a log raftnine logs fast together  We
went out with the skiff and towed it ashore  Then we had dinner
Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through so as to catch
more stuff but that warnt paps style  Nine logs was enough for one
time he must shove right over to town and sell  So he locked me in and
took the skiff and started off towing the raft about halfpast three  I
judged he wouldnt come back that night  I waited till I reckoned he had
got a good start then I out with my saw and went to work on that log
again  Before he was tother side of the river I was out of the hole
him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder

I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid and
shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in then I done the same
with the side of bacon then the whiskyjug  I took all the coffee and
sugar there was and all the ammunition I took the wadding I took the
bucket and gourd I took a dipper and a tin cup and my old saw and two
blankets and the skillet and the coffeepot  I took fishlines and
matches and other thingseverything that was worth a cent  I cleaned
out the place  I wanted an axe but there wasnt any only the one out
at the woodpile and I knowed why I was going to leave that  I fetched
out the gun and now I was done

I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging
out so many things  So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside
by scattering dust on the place which covered up the smoothness and the
sawdust  Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place and put two
rocks under it and one against it to hold it there for it was bent up at
that place and didnt quite touch ground  If you stood four or five foot
away and didnt know it was sawed you wouldnt never notice it and
besides this was the back of the cabin and it warnt likely anybody
would go fooling around there

It was all grass clear to the canoe so I hadnt left a track  I
followed around to see  I stood on the bank and looked out over the
river  All safe  So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods
and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig hogs soon
went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms
I shot this fellow and took him into camp

I took the axe and smashed in the door  I beat it and hacked it
considerable adoing it  I fetched the pig in and took him back nearly
to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe and laid him down
on the ground to bleed I say ground because it was groundhard packed
and no boards  Well next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks
in itall I could dragand I started it from the pig and dragged it
to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in and
down it sunk out of sight  You could easy see that something had been
dragged over the ground  I did wish Tom Sawyer was there I knowed he
would take an interest in this kind of business and throw in the fancy
touches  Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as
that

Well last I pulled out some of my hair and blooded the axe good and
stuck it on the back side and slung the axe in the corner  Then I took
up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket so he couldnt drip
till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the
river  Now I thought of something else  So I went and got the bag of
meal and my old saw out of the canoe and fetched them to the house  I
took the bag to where it used to stand and ripped a hole in the bottom
of it with the saw for there warnt no knives and forks on the place
pap done everything with his claspknife about the cooking  Then I
carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the
willows east of the house to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and
full of rushesand ducks too you might say in the season  There was a
slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles
away I dont know where but it didnt go to the river  The meal sifted
out and made a little track all the way to the lake  I dropped paps
whetstone there too so as to look like it had been done by accident
Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string so it wouldnt
leak no more and took it and my saw to the canoe again

It was about dark now so I dropped the canoe down the river under some
willows that hung over the bank and waited for the moon to rise  I made
fast to a willow then I took a bite to eat and by and by laid down in
the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan  I says to myself theyll
follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the
river for me  And theyll follow that meal track to the lake and go
browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that
killed me and took the things  They wont ever hunt the river for
anything but my dead carcass Theyll soon get tired of that and wont
bother no more about me  All right I can stop anywhere I want to
Jacksons Island is good enough for me I know that island pretty well
and nobody ever comes there  And then I can paddle over to town nights
and slink around and pick up things I want Jacksons Islands the place

I was pretty tired and the first thing I knowed I was asleep  When I
woke up I didnt know where I was for a minute  I set up and looked
around a little scared  Then I remembered  The river looked miles and
miles across  The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs
that went aslipping along black and still hundreds of yards out from
shore Everything was dead quiet and it looked late and SMELT late
You know what I meanI dont know the words to put it in

I took a good gap and a stretch and was just going to unhitch and start
when I heard a sound away over the water  I listened  Pretty soon I
made it out  It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from
oars working in rowlocks when its a still night  I peeped out through
the willow branches and there it wasa skiff away across the water  I
couldnt tell how many was in it  It kept acoming and when it was
abreast of me I see there warnt but one man in it  Thinks I maybe
its pap though I warnt expecting him  He dropped below me with the
current and by and by he came aswinging up shore in the easy water and
he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him  Well
it WAS pap sure enoughand sober too by the way he laid his oars

I didnt lose no time  The next minute I was aspinning down stream soft
but quick in the shade of the bank  I made two mile and a half and then
struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river
because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing and people
might see me and hail me  I got out amongst the driftwood and then laid
down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float  I laid there and had
a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe looking away into the sky not a
cloud in it  The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back
in the moonshine I never knowed it before  And how far a body can hear
on the water such nights  I heard people talking at the ferry landing
I heard what they said tooevery word of it  One man said it was
getting towards the long days and the short nights now  Tother one said
THIS warnt one of the short ones he reckonedand then they laughed
and he said it over again and they laughed again then they waked up
another fellow and told him and laughed but he didnt laugh he ripped
out something brisk and said let him alone  The first fellow said he
lowed to tell it to his old womanshe would think it was pretty good
but he said that warnt nothing to some things he had said in his time
I heard one man say it was nearly three oclock and he hoped daylight
wouldnt wait more than about a week longer  After that the talk got
further and further away and I couldnt make out the words any more but
I could hear the mumble and now and then a laugh too but it seemed a
long ways off

I was away below the ferry now  I rose up and there was Jacksons
Island about two mile and a half down stream heavy timbered and
standing up out of the middle of the river big and dark and solid like
a steamboat without any lights  There warnt any signs of the bar at the
headit was all under water now

It didnt take me long to get there  I shot past the head at a ripping
rate the current was so swift and then I got into the dead water and
landed on the side towards the Illinois shore  I run the canoe into a
deep dent in the bank that I knowed about I had to part the willow
branches to get in and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe
from the outside

I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island and looked out
on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town three
mile away where there was three or four lights twinkling  A monstrous
big lumberraft was about a mile up stream coming along down with a
lantern in the middle of it  I watched it come creeping down and when
it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say Stern oars
there heave her head to stabboard  I heard that just as plain as if
the man was by my side

There was a little gray in the sky now so I stepped into the woods and
laid down for a nap before breakfast




CHAPTER VIII

THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight
oclock  I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about
things and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied  I could
see the sun out at one or two holes but mostly it was big trees all
about and gloomy in there amongst them  There was freckled places on
the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves and the
freckled places swapped about a little showing there was a little breeze
up there  A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very
friendly

I was powerful lazy and comfortabledidnt want to get up and cook
breakfast  Well I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep
sound of boom away up the river  I rouses up and rests on my elbow
and listens pretty soon I hears it again  I hopped up and went and
looked out at a hole in the leaves and I see a bunch of smoke laying on
the water a long ways upabout abreast the ferry  And there was the
ferryboat full of people floating along down  I knowed what was the
matter now  Boom I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboats
side  You see they was firing cannon over the water trying to make my
carcass come to the top

I was pretty hungry but it warnt going to do for me to start a fire
because they might see the smoke  So I set there and watched the
cannonsmoke and listened to the boom  The river was a mile wide there
and it always looks pretty on a summer morningso I was having a good
enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to
eat Well then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in
loaves of bread and float them off because they always go right to the
drownded carcass and stop there  So says I Ill keep a lookout and if
any of thems floating around after me Ill give them a show  I changed
to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have and I
warnt disappointed  A big double loaf come along and I most got it
with a long stick but my foot slipped and she floated out further  Of
course I was where the current set in the closest to the shoreI knowed
enough for that  But by and by along comes another one and this time I
won  I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver
and set my teeth in  It was bakers breadwhat the quality eat none
of your lowdown cornpone

I got a good place amongst the leaves and set there on a log munching
the bread and watching the ferryboat and very well satisfied  And then
something struck me  I says now I reckon the widow or the parson or
somebody prayed that this bread would find me and here it has gone and
done it  So there aint no doubt but there is something in that thing
that is theres something in it when a body like the widow or the parson
prays but it dont work for me and I reckon it dont work for only just
the right kind

I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke and went on watching  The
ferryboat was floating with the current and I allowed Id have a chance
to see who was aboard when she come along because she would come in
close where the bread did  When shed got pretty well along down
towards me I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread
and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place  Where the
log forked I could peep through

By and by she come along and she drifted in so close that they could a
run out a plank and walked ashore  Most everybody was on the boat  Pap
and Judge Thatcher and Bessie Thatcher and Jo Harper and Tom Sawyer
and his old Aunt Polly and Sid and Mary and plenty more  Everybody was
talking about the murder but the captain broke in and says

Look sharp now the current sets in the closest here and maybe hes
washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the waters edge  I
hope so anyway

I didnt hope so  They all crowded up and leaned over the rails nearly
in my face and kept still watching with all their might  I could see
them firstrate but they couldnt see me  Then the captain sung out

Stand away and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it
made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke and I
judged I was gone  If theyd a had some bullets in I reckon theyd a
got the corpse they was after  Well I see I warnt hurt thanks to
goodness The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder
of the island  I could hear the booming now and then further and
further off and by and by after an hour I didnt hear it no more  The
island was three mile long  I judged they had got to the foot and was
giving it up  But they didnt yet a while  They turned around the foot
of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side under
steam and booming once in a while as they went  I crossed over to that
side and watched them When they got abreast the head of the island they
quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the
town

I knowed I was all right now  Nobody else would come ahunting after me
I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick
woods  I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under
so the rain couldnt get at them  I catched a catfish and haggled him
open with my saw and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had
supper  Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast

When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking and feeling pretty well
satisfied but by and by it got sort of lonesome and so I went and set
on the bank and listened to the current swashing along and counted the
stars and drift logs and rafts that come down and then went to bed
there aint no better way to put in time when you are lonesome you cant
stay so you soon get over it

And so for three days and nights  No differencejust the same thing
But the next day I went exploring around down through the island  I was
boss of it it all belonged to me so to say and I wanted to know all
about it but mainly I wanted to put in the time  I found plenty
strawberries ripe and prime and green summer grapes and green
razberries and the green blackberries was just beginning to show  They
would all come handy by and by I judged

Well I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I warnt far
from the foot of the island  I had my gun along but I hadnt shot
nothing it was for protection thought I would kill some game nigh home
About this time I mighty near stepped on a goodsized snake and it went
sliding off through the grass and flowers and I after it trying to get
a shot at it I clipped along and all of a sudden I bounded right on to
the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking

My heart jumped up amongst my lungs  I never waited for to look further
but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever
I could  Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves
and listened but my breath come so hard I couldnt hear nothing else  I
slunk along another piece further then listened again and so on and so
on  If I see a stump I took it for a man if I trod on a stick and
broke it it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two
and I only got half and the short half too

When I got to camp I warnt feeling very brash there warnt much sand in
my craw but I says this aint no time to be fooling around  So I got
all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight and I
put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last
years camp and then clumb a tree

I reckon I was up in the tree two hours but I didnt see nothing I
didnt hear nothingI only THOUGHT I heard and seen as much as a
thousand things  Well I couldnt stay up there forever so at last I
got down but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time
All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast

By the time it was night I was pretty hungry  So when it was good and
dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the
Illinois bankabout a quarter of a mile  I went out in the woods and
cooked a supper and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all
night when I hear a PLUNKETYPLUNK PLUNKETYPLUNK and says to myself
horses coming and next I hear peoples voices  I got everything into
the canoe as quick as I could and then went creeping through the woods
to see what I could find out  I hadnt got far when I hear a man say

We better camp here if we can find a good place the horses is about
beat out  Lets look around

I didnt wait but shoved out and paddled away easy  I tied up in the
old place and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe

I didnt sleep much  I couldnt somehow for thinking  And every time
I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck  So the sleep didnt do
me no good  By and by I says to myself I cant live this way Im
agoing to find out who it is thats here on the island with me Ill
find it out or bust  Well I felt better right off

So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two and then
let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows  The moon was shining
and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day  I poked
along well on to an hour everything still as rocks and sound asleep
Well by this time I was most down to the foot of the island  A little
ripply cool breeze begun to blow and that was as good as saying the
night was about done  I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her
nose to shore then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the
woods  I sat down there on a log and looked out through the leaves  I
see the moon go off watch and the darkness begin to blanket the river
But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops and knowed
the day was coming  So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had
run across that camp fire stopping every minute or two to listen  But I
hadnt no luck somehow I couldnt seem to find the place  But by and
by sure enough I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees  I
went for it cautious and slow  By and by I was close enough to have a
look and there laid a man on the ground  It most give me the fantods
He had a blanket around his head and his head was nearly in the fire  I
set there behind a clump of bushes in about six foot of him and kept my
eyes on him steady  It was getting gray daylight now  Pretty soon he
gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket and it was Miss
Watsons Jim  I bet I was glad to see him  I says

Hello Jim and skipped out

He bounced up and stared at me wild  Then he drops down on his knees
and puts his hands together and says

Doan hurt medont  I haint ever done no harm to a ghos  I alwuz
liked dead people en done all I could for em  You go en git in de
river agin whah you blongs en doan do nuffn to Ole Jim at uz awluz
yo fren

Well I warnt long making him understand I warnt dead  I was ever so
glad to see Jim  I warnt lonesome now  I told him I warnt afraid of
HIM telling the people where I was  I talked along but he only set
there and looked at me never said nothing  Then I says

Its good daylight  Les get breakfast  Make up your camp fire good

Whats de use er makin up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich
truck But you got a gun haint you  Den we kin git sumfn better den
strawbries

Strawberries and such truck I says  Is that what you live on

I couldn git nuffn else he says

Why how long you been on the island Jim

I come heah de night arter yous killed

What all that time

Yesindeedy

And aint you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat

No sahnuffn else

Well you must be most starved aint you

I reckn I could eat a hoss  I think I could How long you ben on de
islan

Since the night I got killed

No  Wy what has you lived on  But you got a gun  Oh yes you got a
gun  Dats good  Now you kill sumfn en Ill make up de fire

So we went over to where the canoe was and while he built a fire in a
grassy open place amongst the trees I fetched meal and bacon and coffee
and coffeepot and fryingpan and sugar and tin cups and the nigger was
set back considerable because he reckoned it was all done with
witchcraft I catched a good big catfish too and Jim cleaned him with
his knife and fried him

When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot
Jim laid it in with all his might for he was most about starved  Then
when we had got pretty well stuffed we laid off and lazied  By and by
Jim says

But looky here Huck who wuz it dat uz killed in dat shanty ef it
warnt you

Then I told him the whole thing and he said it was smart  He said Tom
Sawyer couldnt get up no better plan than what I had  Then I says

How do you come to be here Jim and howd you get here

He looked pretty uneasy and didnt say nothing for a minute  Then he
says

Maybe I better not tell

Why Jim

Well deys reasons  But you wouldn tell on me ef I uz to tell you
would you Huck

Blamed if I would Jim

Well I blieve you Huck  II RUN OFF

Jim

But mind you said you wouldn tellyou know you said you wouldn tell
Huck

Well I did  I said I wouldnt and Ill stick to it  Honest INJUN I
will  People would call me a lowdown Abolitionist and despise me for
keeping mumbut that dont make no difference  I aint agoing to tell

Oh yes  I knowed dey was arter you  I see um go by heahwatched um
thoo de bushes

Some young birds come along flying a yard or two at a time and lighting
Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain  He said it was a sign when
young chickens flew that way and so he reckoned it was the same way when
young birds done it  I was going to catch some of them but Jim wouldnt
let me  He said it was death  He said his father laid mighty sick once
and some of them catched a bird and his old granny said his father would
die and he did

And Jim said you mustnt count the things you are going to cook for
dinner because that would bring bad luck  The same if you shook the
tablecloth after sundown  And he said if a man owned a beehive and that
man died the bees must be told about it before sunup next morning or
else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die  Jim said bees
wouldnt sting idiots but I didnt believe that because I had tried
them lots of times myself and they wouldnt sting me

I had heard about some of these things before but not all of them  Jim
knowed all kinds of signs  He said he knowed most everything  I said it
looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck and so I asked him if
there warnt any goodluck signs  He says

Mighty fewan DEY aint no use to a body  What you want to know when
good lucks acomin for  Want to keep it off  And he said  Ef yous
got hairy arms en a hairy breas its a sign dat yous agwyne to be

CHAPTER IX

I WANTED to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island
that Id found when I was exploring so we started and soon got to it
because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile
wide

This place was a tolerable long steep hill or ridge about forty foot
high We had a rough time getting to the top the sides was so steep and
the bushes so thick  We tramped and clumb around all over it and by and
by found a good big cavern in the rock most up to the top on the side
towards Illinois  The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched
together and Jim could stand up straight in it  It was cool in there
Jim was for putting our traps in there right away but I said we didnt
want to be climbing up and down there all the time

Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place and had all the traps
in the cavern we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island
and they would never find us without dogs  And besides he said them
little birds had said it was going to rain and did I want the things to
get wet

So we went back and got the canoe and paddled up abreast the cavern and
lugged all the traps up there  Then we hunted up a place close by to
hide the canoe in amongst the thick willows  We took some fish off of
the lines and set them again and begun to get ready for dinner

The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in and on one
side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit and was flat and a
good place to build a fire on  So we built it there and cooked dinner

We spread the blankets inside for a carpet and eat our dinner in there
We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern  Pretty soon
it darkened up and begun to thunder and lighten so the birds was right
about it  Directly it begun to rain and it rained like all fury too
and I never see the wind blow so  It was one of these regular summer
storms  It would get so dark that it looked all blueblack outside and
lovely and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a
little ways looked dim and spiderwebby and here would come a blast of
wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the
leaves and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set
the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild and next
when it was just about the bluest and blackestFST it was as bright as
glory and youd have a little glimpse of treetops aplunging about away
off yonder in the storm hundreds of yards further than you could see
before dark as sin again in a second and now youd hear the thunder let
go with an awful crash and then go rumbling grumbling tumbling down
the sky towards the under side of the world like rolling empty barrels
down stairswhere its long stairs and they bounce a good deal you
know

Jim this is nice I says  I wouldnt want to be nowhere else but
here Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot cornbread

Well you wouldnt a ben here f it hadnt a ben for Jim  Youd a ben
down dah in de woods widout any dinner en gittn mos drownded too dat
you would honey  Chickens knows when its gwyne to rain en so do de
birds chile

The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days till at
last it was over the banks  The water was three or four foot deep on the
island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom  On that side it was
a good many miles wide but on the Missouri side it was the same old
distance acrossa half a milebecause the Missouri shore was just a
wall of high bluffs

Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe It was mighty cool
and shady in the deep woods even if the sun was blazing outside  We
went winding in and out amongst the trees and sometimes the vines hung
so thick we had to back away and go some other way  Well on every old
brokendown tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things and
when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame on
account of being hungry that you could paddle right up and put your hand
on them if you wanted to but not the snakes and turtlesthey would
slide off in the water  The ridge our cavern was in was full of them
We could a had pets enough if wed wanted them

One night we catched a little section of a lumber raftnice pine planks
It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long and the
top stood above water six or seven inchesa solid level floor  We
could see sawlogs go by in the daylight sometimes but we let them go
we didnt show ourselves in daylight

Another night when we was up at the head of the island just before
daylight here comes a framehouse down on the west side  She was a
twostory and tilted over considerable  We paddled out and got aboard
clumb in at an upstairs window  But it was too dark to see yet so we
made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight

The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island  Then we
looked in at the window  We could make out a bed and a table and two
old chairs and lots of things around about on the floor and there was
clothes hanging against the wall  There was something laying on the
floor in the far corner that looked like a man  So Jim says

Hello you

But it didnt budge  So I hollered again and then Jim says

De man aint asleephes dead  You hold stillIll go en see

He went and bent down and looked and says

Its a dead man  Yes indeedy naked too  Hes ben shot in de back
I reckn hes ben dead two er three days  Come in Huck but doan look
at his faceits too gashly

I didnt look at him at all  Jim throwed some old rags over him but he
neednt done it I didnt want to see him  There was heaps of old greasy
cards scattered around over the floor and old whisky bottles and a
couple of masks made out of black cloth and all over the walls was the
ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal  There was two
old dirty calico dresses and a sunbonnet and some womens underclothes
hanging against the wall and some mens clothing too  We put the lot
into the canoeit might come good  There was a boys old speckled straw
hat on the floor I took that too  And there was a bottle that had had
milk in it and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck  We would a took
the bottle but it was broke  There was a seedy old chest and an old
hair trunk with the hinges broke  They stood open but there warnt
nothing left in them that was any account  The way things was scattered
about we reckoned the people left in a hurry and warnt fixed so as to
carry off most of their stuff

We got an old tin lantern and a butcherknife without any handle and a
brannew Barlow knife worth two bits in any store and a lot of tallow
candles and a tin candlestick and a gourd and a tin cup and a ratty
old bedquilt off the bed and a reticule with needles and pins and
beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it and a hatchet
and some nails and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some
monstrous hooks on it and a roll of buckskin and a leather dogcollar
and a horseshoe and some vials of medicine that didnt have no label on
them and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good currycomb and
Jim he found a ratty old fiddlebow and a wooden leg  The straps was
broke off of it but barring that it was a good enough leg though it
was too long for me and not long enough for Jim and we couldnt find the
other one though we hunted all around

And so take it all around we made a good haul  When we was ready to
shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island and it was pretty
broad day so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the
quilt because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways
off  I paddled over to the Illinois shore and drifted down most a half
a mile doing it  I crept up the dead water under the bank and hadnt no
accidents and didnt see nobody  We got home all safe




CHAPTER X

AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he
come to be killed but Jim didnt want to  He said it would fetch bad
luck and besides he said he might come and hant us he said a man
that warnt buried was more likely to go ahanting around than one that
was planted and comfortable  That sounded pretty reasonable so I didnt
say no more but I couldnt keep from studying over it and wishing I
knowed who shot the man and what they done it for

We rummaged the clothes wed got and found eight dollars in silver sewed
up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat  Jim said he reckoned the
people in that house stole the coat because if theyd a knowed the money
was there they wouldnt a left it  I said I reckoned they killed him
too but Jim didnt want to talk about that  I says

Now you think its bad luck but what did you say when I fetched in the
snakeskin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday
You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snakeskin
with my hands  Well heres your bad luck  Weve raked in all this
truck and eight dollars besides  I wish we could have some bad luck like
this every day Jim

Never you mind honey never you mind  Dont you git too peart  Its
acomin  Mind I tell you its acomin

It did come too  It was a Tuesday that we had that talk  Well after
dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the
ridge and got out of tobacco  I went to the cavern to get some and
found a rattlesnake in there  I killed him and curled him up on the
foot of Jims blanket ever so natural thinking thered be some fun when
Jim found him there  Well by night I forgot all about the snake and
when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the
snakes mate was there and bit him

He jumped up yelling and the first thing the light showed was the
varmint curled up and ready for another spring  I laid him out in a
second with a stick and Jim grabbed paps whiskyjug and begun to pour
it down

He was barefooted and the snake bit him right on the heel  That all
comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave
a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it  Jim told
me to chop off the snakes head and throw it away and then skin the body
and roast a piece of it  I done it and he eat it and said it would help
cure him He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist
too  He said that that would help  Then I slid out quiet and throwed
the snakes clear away amongst the bushes for I warnt going to let Jim
find out it was all my fault not if I could help it

Jim sucked and sucked at the jug and now and then he got out of his head
and pitched around and yelled but every time he come to himself he went
to sucking at the jug again  His foot swelled up pretty big and so did
his leg but by and by the drunk begun to come and so I judged he was
all right but Id druther been bit with a snake than paps whisky

Jim was laid up for four days and nights  Then the swelling was all gone
and he was around again  I made up my mind I wouldnt ever take aholt
of a snakeskin again with my hands now that I see what had come of it
Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time  And he said that
handling a snakeskin was such awful bad luck that maybe we hadnt got to
the end of it yet  He said he druther see the new moon over his left
shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snakeskin in his
hand  Well I was getting to feel that way myself though Ive always
reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of
the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do  Old Hank Bunker
done it once and bragged about it and in less than two years he got
drunk and fell off of the shottower and spread himself out so that he
was just a kind of a layer as you may say and they slid him edgeways
between two barn doors for a coffin and buried him so so they say but
I didnt see it  Pap told me  But anyway it all come of looking at the
moon that way like a fool

Well the days went along and the river went down between its banks
again and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks
with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a
man being six foot two inches long and weighed over two hundred pounds
We couldnt handle him of course he would a flung us into Illinois  We
just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded  We
found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball and lots of
rubbage  We split the ball open with the hatchet and there was a spool
in it  Jim said hed had it there a long time to coat it over so and
make a ball of it  It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the
Mississippi I reckon  Jim said he hadnt ever seen a bigger one  He
would a been worth a good deal over at the village  They peddle out such
a fish as that by the pound in the markethouse there everybody buys
some of him his meats as white as snow and makes a good fry

Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull and I wanted to get a
stirring up some way  I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and
find out what was going on  Jim liked that notion but he said I must go
in the dark and look sharp  Then he studied it over and said couldnt I
put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl  That was a good
notion too  So we shortened up one of the calico gowns and I turned up
my trouserlegs to my knees and got into it  Jim hitched it behind with
the hooks and it was a fair fit  I put on the sunbonnet and tied it
under my chin and then for a body to look in and see my face was like
looking down a joint of stovepipe  Jim said nobody would know me even
in the daytime hardly  I practiced around all day to get the hang of
the things and by and by I could do pretty well in them only Jim said I
didnt walk like a girl and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to
get at my britchespocket  I took notice and done better

I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark

I started across to the town from a little below the ferrylanding and
the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town  I tied
up and started along the bank  There was a light burning in a little
shanty that hadnt been lived in for a long time and I wondered who had
took up quarters there  I slipped up and peeped in at the window  There
was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was
on a pine table  I didnt know her face she was a stranger for you
couldnt start a face in that town that I didnt know  Now this was
lucky because I was weakening I was getting afraid I had come people
might know my voice and find me out  But if this woman had been in such
a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know so I
knocked at the door and made up my mind I wouldnt forget I was a girl




CHAPTER XI

COME in says the woman and I did  She says  Take a cheer

I done it  She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes and says

What might your name be

Sarah Williams

Where bouts do you live  In this neighborhood

Nom  In Hookerville seven mile below  Ive walked all the way and
Im all tired out

Hungry too I reckon  Ill find you something

Nom I aint hungry  I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below
here at a farm so I aint hungry no more  Its what makes me so late
My mothers down sick and out of money and everything and I come to
tell my uncle Abner Moore  He lives at the upper end of the town she
says  I haint ever been here before  Do you know him

No but I dont know everybody yet  I havent lived here quite two
weeks Its a considerable ways to the upper end of the town  You better
stay here all night  Take off your bonnet

No I says Ill rest a while I reckon and go on  I aint afeared
of the dark

She said she wouldnt let me go by myself but her husband would be in by
and by maybe in a hour and a half and shed send him along with me
Then she got to talking about her husband and about her relations up the
river and her relations down the river and about how much better off
they used to was and how they didnt know but theyd made a mistake
coming to our town instead of letting well aloneand so on and so on
till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was
going on in the town but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder
and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along  She told
about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars only she got it
ten and all about pap and what a hard lot he was and what a hard lot I
was and at last she got down to where I was murdered  I says

Who done it  Weve heard considerable about these goings on down in
Hookerville but we dont know who twas that killed Huck Finn

Well I reckon theres a right smart chance of people HERE thatd like
to know who killed him  Some think old Finn done it himself

Nois that so

Most everybody thought it at first  Hell never know how nigh he come
to getting lynched  But before night they changed around and judged it
was done by a runaway nigger named Jim

Why HE

I stopped  I reckoned I better keep still  She run on and never
noticed I had put in at all

The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed  So theres a
reward out for himthree hundred dollars  And theres a reward out for
old Finn tootwo hundred dollars  You see he come to town the morning
after the murder and told about it and was out with em on the
ferryboat hunt and right away after he up and left  Before night they
wanted to lynch him but he was gone you see  Well next day they found
out the nigger was gone they found out he hadnt ben seen sence ten
oclock the night the murder was done  So then they put it on him you
see and while they was full of it next day back comes old Finn and
went boohooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all
over Illinois with The judge gave him some and that evening he got
drunk and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty
hardlooking strangers and then went off with them  Well he haint
come back sence and they aint looking for him back till this thing
blows over a little for people thinks now that he killed his boy and
fixed things so folks would think robbers done it and then hed get
Hucks money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit  People
do say he warnt any too good to do it  Oh hes sly I reckon  If he
dont come back for a year hell be all right  You cant prove anything
on him you know everything will be quieted down then and hell walk in
Hucks money as easy as nothing

Yes I reckon so m  I dont see nothing in the way of it  Has
everybody quit thinking the nigger done it

Oh no not everybody  A good many thinks he done it  But theyll get
the nigger pretty soon now and maybe they can scare it out of him

Why are they after him yet

Well youre innocent aint you  Does three hundred dollars lay around
every day for people to pick up  Some folks think the nigger aint far
from here  Im one of thembut I haint talked it around  A few days
ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log
shanty and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island
over yonder that they call Jacksons Island  Dont anybody live there
says I No nobody says they  I didnt say any more but I done some
thinking  I was pretty near certain Id seen smoke over there about the
head of the island a day or two before that so I says to myself like
as not that niggers hiding over there anyway says I its worth the
trouble to give the place a hunt  I haint seen any smoke sence so I
reckon maybe hes gone if it was him but husbands going over to see
him and another man  He was gone up the river but he got back today
and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago

I had got so uneasy I couldnt set still  I had to do something with my
hands so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it
My hands shook and I was making a bad job of it  When the woman stopped
talking I looked up and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling
a little  I put down the needle and thread and let on to be interested
and I was tooand says

Three hundred dollars is a power of money  I wish my mother could get
it Is your husband going over there tonight

Oh yes  He went uptown with the man I was telling you of to get a
boat and see if they could borrow another gun  Theyll go over after
midnight

Couldnt they see better if they was to wait till daytime

Yes  And couldnt the nigger see better too  After midnight hell
likely be asleep and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up
his camp fire all the better for the dark if hes got one

I didnt think of that

The woman kept looking at me pretty curious and I didnt feel a bit
comfortable  Pretty soon she says

What did you say your name was honey

MMary Williams

Somehow it didnt seem to me that I said it was Mary before so I didnt
look upseemed to me I said it was Sarah so I felt sort of cornered
and was afeared maybe I was looking it too  I wished the woman would
say something more the longer she set still the uneasier I was  But now
she says

Honey I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in

Oh yesm I did  Sarah Mary Williams  Sarahs my first name  Some
calls me Sarah some calls me Mary

Oh thats the way of it

Yesm

I was feeling better then but I wished I was out of there anyway  I
couldnt look up yet

Well the woman fell to talking about how hard times was and how poor
they had to live and how the rats was as free as if they owned the
place and so forth and so on and then I got easy again  She was right
about the rats Youd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner
every little while  She said she had to have things handy to throw at
them when she was alone or they wouldnt give her no peace  She showed
me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot and said she was a good shot
with it generly but shed wrenched her arm a day or two ago and didnt
know whether she could throw true now  But she watched for a chance and
directly banged away at a rat but she missed him wide and said Ouch
it hurt her arm so  Then she told me to try for the next one  I wanted
to be getting away before the old man got back but of course I didnt
let on  I got the thing and the first rat that showed his nose I let
drive and if hed a stayed where he was hed a been a tolerable sick
rat  She said that was firstrate and she reckoned I would hive the
next one  She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back and
brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with  I
held up my two hands and she put the hank over them and went on talking
about her and her husbands matters  But she broke off to say

Keep your eye on the rats  You better have the lead in your lap
handy

So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment and I clapped my
legs together on it and she went on talking  But only about a minute
Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face and very
pleasant and says

Come now whats your real name

Whwhat mum

Whats your real name  Is it Bill or Tom or Bobor what is it

I reckon I shook like a leaf and I didnt know hardly what to do  But I
says

Please to dont poke fun at a poor girl like me mum  If Im in the way
here Ill

No you wont  Set down and stay where you are  I aint going to hurt
you and I aint going to tell on you nuther  You just tell me your
secret and trust me  Ill keep it and whats more Ill help you
Soll my old man if you want him to  You see youre a runaway
prentice thats all  It aint anything  There aint no harm in it
Youve been treated bad and you made up your mind to cut  Bless you
child I wouldnt tell on you  Tell me all about it now thats a good
boy

So I said it wouldnt be no use to try to play it any longer and I would
just make a clean breast and tell her everything but she musnt go back
on her promise  Then I told her my father and mother was dead and the
law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back
from the river and he treated me so bad I couldnt stand it no longer
he went away to be gone a couple of days and so I took my chance and
stole some of his daughters old clothes and cleared out and I had been
three nights coming the thirty miles  I traveled nights and hid
daytimes and slept and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home
lasted me all the way and I had aplenty  I said I believed my uncle
Abner Moore would take care of me and so that was why I struck out for
this town of Goshen

Goshen child  This aint Goshen  This is St Petersburg  Goshens
ten mile further up the river  Who told you this was Goshen

Why a man I met at daybreak this morning just as I was going to turn
into the woods for my regular sleep  He told me when the roads forked I
must take the right hand and five mile would fetch me to Goshen

He was drunk I reckon  He told you just exactly wrong

Well he did act like he was drunk but it aint no matter now  I got
to be moving along  Ill fetch Goshen before daylight

Hold on a minute  Ill put you up a snack to eat  You might want it

So she put me up a snack and says

Say when a cows laying down which end of her gets up first  Answer
up prompt nowdont stop to study over it  Which end gets up first

The hind end mum

Well then a horse

The forrard end mum

Which side of a tree does the moss grow on

North side

If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside how many of them eats with
their heads pointed the same direction

The whole fifteen mum

Well I reckon you HAVE lived in the country  I thought maybe you was
trying to hocus me again  Whats your real name now

George Peters mum

Well try to remember it George  Dont forget and tell me its
Elexander before you go and then get out by saying its George Elexander
when I catch you  And dont go about women in that old calico  You do a
girl tolerable poor but you might fool men maybe  Bless you child
when you set out to thread a needle dont hold the thread still and fetch
the needle up to it hold the needle still and poke the thread at it
thats the way a woman most always does but a man always does tother
way  And when you throw at a rat or anything hitch yourself up a tiptoe
and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can and miss
your rat about six or seven foot Throw stiffarmed from the shoulder
like there was a pivot there for it to turn on like a girl not from the
wrist and elbow with your arm out to one side like a boy  And mind
you when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees
apart she dont clap them together the way you did when you catched the
lump of lead  Why I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the
needle and I contrived the other things just to make certain  Now trot
along to your uncle Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters and if
you get into trouble you send word to Mrs Judith Loftus which is me
and Ill do what I can to get you out of it  Keep the river road all the
way and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you The river
roads a rocky one and your feetll be in a condition when you get to
Goshen I reckon

I went up the bank about fifty yards and then I doubled on my tracks and
slipped back to where my canoe was a good piece below the house  I
jumped in and was off in a hurry  I went upstream far enough to make
the head of the island and then started across  I took off the
sunbonnet for I didnt want no blinders on then  When I was about the
middle I heard the clock begin to strike so I stops and listens the
sound come faint over the water but cleareleven  When I struck the
head of the island I never waited to blow though I was most winded but
I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be and started
a good fire there on a high and dry spot

Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place a mile and a half
below as hard as I could go  I landed and slopped through the timber
and up the ridge and into the cavern  There Jim laid sound asleep on
the ground  I roused him out and says

Git up and hump yourself Jim  There aint a minute to lose  Theyre
after us

Jim never asked no questions he never said a word but the way he worked
for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared  By that time
everything we had in the world was on our raft and she was ready to be
shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid  We put out the camp
fire at the cavern the first thing and didnt show a candle outside
after that

I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece and took a look but
if there was a boat around I couldnt see it for stars and shadows aint
good to see by  Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the
shade past the foot of the island dead stillnever saying a word




CHAPTER XII

IT must a been close on to one oclock when we got below the island at
last and the raft did seem to go mighty slow  If a boat was to come
along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore
and it was well a boat didnt come for we hadnt ever thought to put the
gun in the canoe or a fishingline or anything to eat  We was in
ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things  It warnt good
judgment to put EVERYTHING on the raft

If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I
built and watched it all night for Jim to come  Anyways they stayed
away from us and if my building the fire never fooled them it warnt no
fault of mine  I played it as low down on them as I could

When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a
big bend on the Illinois side and hacked off cottonwood branches with
the hatchet and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there
had been a cavein in the bank there  A towhead is a sandbar that has
cottonwoods on it as thick as harrowteeth

We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois
side and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place so we
warnt afraid of anybody running across us  We laid there all day and
watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore and
upbound steamboats fight the big river in the middle  I told Jim all
about the time I had jabbering with that woman and Jim said she was a
smart one and if she was to start after us herself she wouldnt set down
and watch a camp fireno sir shed fetch a dog  Well then I said
why couldnt she tell her husband to fetch a dog  Jim said he bet she
did think of it by the time the men was ready to start and he believed
they must a gone uptown to get a dog and so they lost all that time or
else we wouldnt be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the
villageno indeedy we would be in that same old town again  So I said
I didnt care what was the reason they didnt get us as long as they
didnt

When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the
cottonwood thicket and looked up and down and across nothing in sight
so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam
to get under in blazing weather and rainy and to keep the things dry
Jim made a floor for the wigwam and raised it a foot or more above the
level of the raft so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach
of steamboat waves  Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of
dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it
to its place this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly
the wigwam would keep it from being seen  We made an extra steeringoar
too because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something
We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on because we
must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming
downstream to keep from getting run over but we wouldnt have to light
it for upstream boats unless we see we was in what they call a
crossing for the river was pretty high yet very low banks being still
a little under water so upbound boats didnt always run the channel
but hunted easy water

This second night we run between seven and eight hours with a current
that was making over four mile an hour  We catched fish and talked and
we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness  It was kind of
solemn drifting down the big still river laying on our backs looking
up at the stars and we didnt ever feel like talking loud and it warnt
often that we laughedonly a little kind of a low chuckle  We had
mighty good weather as a general thing and nothing ever happened to us
at allthat night nor the next nor the next

Every night we passed towns some of them away up on black hillsides
nothing but just a shiny bed of lights not a house could you see  The
fifth night we passed St Louis and it was like the whole world lit up
In St Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand
people in St Louis but I never believed it till I see that wonderful
spread of lights at two oclock that still night  There warnt a sound
there everybody was asleep

Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten oclock at some little
village and buy ten or fifteen cents worth of meal or bacon or other
stuff to eat and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warnt roosting
comfortable and took him along  Pap always said take a chicken when
you get a chance because if you dont want him yourself you can easy
find somebody that does and a good deed aint ever forgot  I never see
pap when he didnt want the chicken himself but that is what he used to
say anyway

Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a
watermelon or a mushmelon or a punkin or some new corn or things of
that kind  Pap always said it warnt no harm to borrow things if you was
meaning to pay them back some time but the widow said it warnt anything
but a soft name for stealing and no decent body would do it  Jim said
he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right so the
best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list
and say we wouldnt borrow them any morethen he reckoned it wouldnt be
no harm to borrow the others  So we talked it over all one night
drifting along down the river trying to make up our minds whether to
drop the watermelons or the cantelopes or the mushmelons or what  But
towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory and concluded to
drop crabapples and psimmons  We warnt feeling just right before that
but it was all comfortable now  I was glad the way it come out too
because crabapples aint ever good and the psimmons wouldnt be ripe
for two or three months yet

We shot a waterfowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or
didnt go to bed early enough in the evening  Take it all round we
lived pretty high

The fifth night below St Louis we had a big storm after midnight with a
power of thunder and lightning and the rain poured down in a solid
sheet We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself
When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead
and high rocky bluffs on both sides  By and by says I HelLO Jim
looky yonder It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock  We
was drifting straight down for her  The lightning showed her very
distinct  She was leaning over with part of her upper deck above water
and you could see every little chimblyguy clean and clear and a chair
by the big bell with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it when
the flashes come

Well it being away in the night and stormy and all so mysteriouslike
I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck
laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river  I
wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little and see what there
was there  So I says

Les land on her Jim

But Jim was dead against it at first  He says

I doan want to go fooln long er no wrack  Wes doin blame well en
we better let blame well alone as de good book says  Like as not deys
a watchman on dat wrack

Watchman your grandmother I says there aint nothing to watch but
the texas and the pilothouse and do you reckon anybodys going to resk
his life for a texas and a pilothouse such a night as this when its
likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute  Jim couldnt
say nothing to that so he didnt try  And besides I says we might
borrow something worth having out of the captains stateroom  Seegars I
bet youand cost five cents apiece solid cash  Steamboat captains is
always rich and get sixty dollars a month and THEY dont care a cent
what a thing costs you know long as they want it  Stick a candle in
your pocket I cant rest Jim till we give her a rummaging  Do you
reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing  Not for pie he wouldnt
Hed call it an adventurethats what hed call it and hed land on
that wreck if it was his last act  And wouldnt he throw style into it
wouldnt he spread himself nor nothing  Why youd think it was
Christopher Clumbus discovering KingdomCome  I wish Tom Sawyer WAS
here

Jim he grumbled a little but give in  He said we mustnt talk any more
than we could help and then talk mighty low  The lightning showed us
the wreck again just in time and we fetched the stabboard derrick and
made fast there

The deck was high out here  We went sneaking down the slope of it to
labboard in the dark towards the texas feeling our way slow with our
feet and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys for it was so
dark we couldnt see no sign of them  Pretty soon we struck the forward
end of the skylight and clumb on to it and the next step fetched us in
front of the captains door which was open and by Jimminy away down
through the texashall we see a light and all in the same second we seem
to hear low voices in yonder

Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick and told me to come
along  I says all right and was going to start for the raft but just
then I heard a voice wail out and say

Oh please dont boys I swear I wont ever tell

Another voice said pretty loud

Its a lie Jim Turner  Youve acted this way before  You always want
moren your share of the truck and youve always got it too because
youve swore t if you didnt youd tell  But this time youve said it
jest one time too many  Youre the meanest treacherousest hound in this
country

By this time Jim was gone for the raft  I was just abiling with
curiosity and I says to myself Tom Sawyer wouldnt back out now and so
I wont either Im agoing to see whats going on here  So I dropped on
my hands and knees in the little passage and crept aft in the dark till
there warnt but one stateroom betwixt me and the crosshall of the
texas  Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand
and foot and two men standing over him and one of them had a dim
lantern in his hand and the other one had a pistol  This one kept
pointing the pistol at the mans head on the floor and saying

Id LIKE to  And I orter tooa mean skunk

The man on the floor would shrivel up and say Oh please dont Bill I
haint ever goin to tell

And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say

Deed you AINT  You never said no truer thing n that you bet you
And once he said  Hear him beg and yit if we hadnt got the best of
him and tied him hed a killed us both  And what FOR  Jist for nothn
Jist because we stood on our RIGHTSthats what for  But I lay you
aint agoin to threaten nobody any more Jim Turner  Put UP that
pistol Bill

Bill says

I dont want to Jake Packard  Im for killin himand didnt he kill
old Hatfield jist the same wayand dont he deserve it

But I dont WANT him killed and Ive got my reasons for it

Bless yo heart for them words Jake Packard  Ill never forgit you
longs I live says the man on the floor sort of blubbering

Packard didnt take no notice of that but hung up his lantern on a nail
and started towards where I was there in the dark and motioned Bill to
come  I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards but the boat
slanted so that I couldnt make very good time so to keep from getting
run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side  The
man came apawing along in the dark and when Packard got to my
stateroom he says

Herecome in here

And in he come and Bill after him  But before they got in I was up in
the upper berth cornered and sorry I come  Then they stood there with
their hands on the ledge of the berth and talked  I couldnt see them
but I could tell where they was by the whisky theyd been having  I was
glad I didnt drink whisky but it wouldnt made much difference anyway
because most of the time they couldnt a treed me because I didnt
breathe  I was too scared  And besides a body COULDNT breathe and
hear such talk  They talked low and earnest  Bill wanted to kill
Turner  He says

Hes said hell tell and he will  If we was to give both our shares to
him NOW it wouldnt make no difference after the row and the way weve
served him  Shores youre born hell turn States evidence now you
hear ME  Im for putting him out of his troubles

Som I says Packard very quiet

Blame it Id sorter begun to think you wasnt  Well then thats all
right  Les go and do it

Hold on a minute I haint had my say yit  You listen to me
Shootings good but theres quieter ways if the things GOT to be done
But what I say is this  it aint good sense to go courtn around after a
halter if you can git at what youre up to in some way thats jist as
good and at the same time dont bring you into no resks  Aint that so

You bet it is  But how you goin to manage it this time

Well my idea is this  well rustle around and gather up whatever
pickins weve overlooked in the staterooms and shove for shore and hide
the truck Then well wait  Now I say it aint agoin to be moren two
hours befo this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river  See
Hell be drownded and wont have nobody to blame for it but his own
self  I reckon thats a considerble sight better n killin of him  Im
unfavorable to killin a man as long as you can git aroun it it aint
good sense it aint good morals  Aint I right

Yes I reckn you are  But spose she DONT break up and wash off

Well we can wait the two hours anyway and see cant we

All right then come along

So they started and I lit out all in a cold sweat and scrambled
forward It was dark as pitch there but I said in a kind of a coarse
whisper Jim and he answered up right at my elbow with a sort of a
moan and I says

Quick Jim it aint no time for fooling around and moaning theres a
gang of murderers in yonder and if we dont hunt up their boat and set
her drifting down the river so these fellows cant get away from the
wreck theres one of em going to be in a bad fix  But if we find their
boat we can put ALL of em in a bad fixfor the sheriff ll get em
Quickhurry  Ill hunt the labboard side you hunt the stabboard
You start at the raft and

Oh my lordy lordy  RAF  Dey ain no raf no mo she done broke
loose en gone Ien here we is




CHAPTER XIII

WELL I catched my breath and most fainted  Shut up on a wreck with such
a gang as that  But it warnt no time to be sentimentering  Wed GOT to
find that boat nowhad to have it for ourselves  So we went aquaking
and shaking down the stabboard side and slow work it was tooseemed a
week before we got to the stern  No sign of a boat  Jim said he didnt
believe he could go any furtherso scared he hadnt hardly any strength
left he said  But I said come on if we get left on this wreck we are
in a fix sure  So on we prowled again  We struck for the stern of the
texas and found it and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight
hanging on from shutter to shutter for the edge of the skylight was in
the water  When we got pretty close to the crosshall door there was the
skiff sure enough  I could just barely see her  I felt ever so
thankful  In another second I would a been aboard of her but just then
the door opened  One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple
of foot from me and I thought I was gone but he jerked it in again and
says

Heave that blame lantern out o sight Bill

He flung a bag of something into the boat and then got in himself and
set down  It was Packard  Then Bill HE come out and got in  Packard
says in a low voice

All readyshove off

I couldnt hardly hang on to the shutters I was so weak  But Bill says

Hold ond you go through him

No  Didnt you

No  So hes got his share o the cash yet

Well then come along no use to take truck and leave money

Say wont he suspicion what were up to

Maybe he wont  But we got to have it anyway Come along

So they got out and went in

The door slammed to because it was on the careened side and in a half
second I was in the boat and Jim come tumbling after me  I out with my
knife and cut the rope and away we went

We didnt touch an oar and we didnt speak nor whisper nor hardly even
breathe  We went gliding swift along dead silent past the tip of the
paddlebox and past the stern then in a second or two more we was a
hundred yards below the wreck and the darkness soaked her up every last
sign of her and we was safe and knowed it

When we was three or four hundred yards downstream we see the lantern
show like a little spark at the texas door for a second and we knowed by
that that the rascals had missed their boat and was beginning to
understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was

Then Jim manned the oars and we took out after our raft  Now was the
first time that I begun to worry about the menI reckon I hadnt had
time to before  I begun to think how dreadful it was even for
murderers to be in such a fix  I says to myself there aint no telling
but I might come to be a murderer myself yet and then how would I like
it  So says I to Jim

The first light we see well land a hundred yards below it or above it
in a place where its a good hidingplace for you and the skiff and then
Ill go and fix up some kind of a yarn and get somebody to go for that
gang and get them out of their scrape so they can be hung when their
time comes

But that idea was a failure for pretty soon it begun to storm again and
this time worse than ever  The rain poured down and never a light
showed everybody in bed I reckon  We boomed along down the river
watching for lights and watching for our raft  After a long time the
rain let up but the clouds stayed and the lightning kept whimpering
and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead floating and we
made for it

It was the raft and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again  We
seen a light now away down to the right on shore  So I said I would go
for it The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole
there on the wreck  We hustled it on to the raft in a pile and I told
Jim to float along down and show a light when he judged he had gone
about two mile and keep it burning till I come then I manned my oars
and shoved for the light  As I got down towards it three or four more
showedup on a hillside  It was a village  I closed in above the shore
light and laid on my oars and floated  As I went by I see it was a
lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a doublehull ferryboat  I skimmed
around for the watchman awondering whereabouts he slept and by and by
I found him roosting on the bitts forward with his head down between his
knees  I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves and begun to cry

He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way but when he see it was only
me he took a good gap and stretch and then he says

Hello whats up  Dont cry bub  Whats the trouble

I says

Pap and mam and sis and

Then I broke down  He says

Oh dang it now DONT take on so we all has to have our troubles and
this n ll come out all right  Whats the matter with em

Theyretheyreare you the watchman of the boat

Yes he says kind of prettywellsatisfied like  Im the captain and
the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deckhand and
sometimes Im the freight and passengers  I aint as rich as old Jim
Hornback and I cant be so blame generous and good to Tom Dick and
Harry as what he is and slam around money the way he does but Ive told
him a many a time t I wouldnt trade places with him for says I a
sailors lifes the life for me and Im derned if ID live two mile out
o town where there aint nothing ever goin on not for all his
spondulicks and as much more on top of it  Says I

I broke in and says

Theyre in an awful peck of trouble and

WHO is

Why pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker and if youd take your
ferryboat and go up there

Up where  Where are they

On the wreck

What wreck

Why there aint but one

What you dont mean the Walter Scott

Yes

Good land what are they doin THERE for gracious sakes

Well they didnt go there apurpose

I bet they didnt  Why great goodness there aint no chance for em
if they dont git off mighty quick  Why how in the nation did they ever
git into such a scrape

Easy enough  Miss Hooker was avisiting up there to the town

Yes Booths Landinggo on

She was avisiting there at Booths Landing and just in the edge of the
evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horseferry to stay
all night at her friends house Miss Whatyoumaycallher I disremember
her nameand they lost their steeringoar and swung around and went
afloating down stern first about two mile and saddlebaggsed on the
wreck and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost
but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck  Well about an
hour after dark we come along down in our tradingscow and it was so
dark we didnt notice the wreck till we was right on it and so WE
saddlebaggsed but all of us was saved but Bill Whippleand oh he WAS
the best creturI most wish t it had been me I do

My George  Its the beatenest thing I ever struck  And THEN what did
you all do

Well we hollered and took on but its so wide there we couldnt make
nobody hear  So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help
somehow I was the only one that could swim so I made a dash for it and
Miss Hooker she said if I didnt strike help sooner come here and hunt
up her uncle and hed fix the thing  I made the land about a mile
below and been fooling along ever since trying to get people to do
something but they said What in such a night and such a current
There aint no sense in it go for the steam ferry  Now if youll go
and

By Jackson Id LIKE to and blame it I dont know but I will but who
in the dingnations agoing to PAY for it  Do you reckon your pap

Why THATS all right  Miss Hooker she tole me PARTICULAR that her
uncle Hornback

Great guns is HE her uncle  Looky here you break for that light over
yonderway and turn out west when you git there and about a quarter of
a mile out youll come to the tavern tell em to dart you out to Jim
Hornbacks and hell foot the bill  And dont you fool around any
because hell want to know the news  Tell him Ill have his niece all
safe before he can get to town  Hump yourself now Im agoing up
around the corner here to roust out my engineer

I struck for the light but as soon as he turned the corner I went back
and got into my skiff and bailed her out and then pulled up shore in the
easy water about six hundred yards and tucked myself in among some
woodboats for I couldnt rest easy till I could see the ferryboat start
But take it all around I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of
taking all this trouble for that gang for not many would a done it  I
wished the widow knowed about it  I judged she would be proud of me for
helping these rapscallions because rapscallions and dead beats is the
kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in

Well before long here comes the wreck dim and dusky sliding along
down A kind of cold shiver went through me and then I struck out for
her  She was very deep and I see in a minute there warnt much chance
for anybody being alive in her  I pulled all around her and hollered a
little but there wasnt any answer all dead still  I felt a little bit
heavyhearted about the gang but not much for I reckoned if they could
stand it I could

Then here comes the ferryboat so I shoved for the middle of the river on
a long downstream slant and when I judged I was out of eyereach I laid
on my oars and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for
Miss Hookers remainders because the captain would know her uncle
Hornback would want them and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up
and went for the shore and I laid into my work and went abooming down
the river

It did seem a powerful long time before Jims light showed up and when
it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off  By the time I got
there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east so we
struck for an island and hid the raft and sunk the skiff and turned in
and slept like dead people




CHAPTER XIV

BY and by when we got up we turned over the truck the gang had stole
off of the wreck and found boots and blankets and clothes and all
sorts of other things and a lot of books and a spyglass and three
boxes of seegars  We hadnt ever been this rich before in neither of our
lives  The seegars was prime  We laid off all the afternoon in the
woods talking and me reading the books and having a general good time
I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat
and I said these kinds of things was adventures but he said he didnt
want no more adventures  He said that when I went in the texas and he
crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died
because he judged it was all up with HIM anyway it could be fixed for if
he didnt get saved he would get drownded and if he did get saved
whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward and
then Miss Watson would sell him South sure  Well he was right he was
most always right he had an uncommon level head for a nigger

I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such and
how gaudy they dressed and how much style they put on and called each
other your majesty and your grace and your lordship and so on stead
of mister and Jims eyes bugged out and he was interested  He says

I didn know dey was so many un um  I haint hearn bout none un um
skasely but ole King Sollermun onless you counts dem kings dats in a
pack er kyards  How much do a king git

Get  I says why they get a thousand dollars a month if they want
it they can have just as much as they want everything belongs to them

AIN dat gay  En what dey got to do Huck

THEY dont do nothing  Why how you talk They just set around

No is dat so

Of course it is  They just set aroundexcept maybe when theres a
war then they go to the war  But other times they just lazy around or
go hawkingjust hawking and spShd you hear a noise

We skipped out and looked but it warnt nothing but the flutter of a
steamboats wheel away down coming around the point so we come back

Yes says I and other times when things is dull they fuss with the
parlyment and if everybody dont go just so he whacks their heads off
But mostly they hang round the harem

Roun de which

Harem

Whats de harem

The place where he keeps his wives  Dont you know about the harem
Solomon had one he had about a million wives

Why yes dats so IId done forgot it  A harems a bodnhouse I
reckn  Mos likely dey has rackety times in de nussery  En I reckn de
wives quarrels considable en dat crease de racket  Yit dey say
Sollermun de wises man dat ever live  I doan take no stock in dat
Bekase why would a wise man want to live in de mids er sich a
blimblammin all de time  Nodeed he wouldnt  A wise man ud take
en buil a bilerfactry en den he could shet DOWN de bilerfactry when

Well but he WAS the wisest man anyway because the widow she told me
so her own self

some er de dadfetchedes ways I ever see  Does you know bout dat chile
dat he uz gwyne to chop in two

I never see such a nigger  If he got a notion in his head once there
warnt no getting it out again  He was the most down on Solomon of any
nigger I ever see  So I went to talking about other kings and let
Solomon slide  I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off in
France long time ago and about his little boy the dolphin that would a
been a king but they took and shut him up in jail and some say he died
there

Po little chap

But some says he got out and got away and come to America

Dats good  But hell be pooty lonesomedey ain no kings here is
dey Huck

No

Den he caint git no situation  What he gwyne to do

Well I dont know  Some of them gets on the police and some of them
learns people how to talk French

Why Huck doan de French people talk de same way we does

NO Jim you couldnt understand a word they saidnot a single word

Well now I be dingbusted  How do dat come

Shucks it aint calling you anything  Its only saying do you know
how to talk French

Well den why couldnt he SAY it

Why he IS asaying it  Thats a Frenchmans WAY of saying it

Well its a blame ridicklous way en I doan want to hear no mo bout

Looky here Jim does a cat talk like we do

So I quit




CHAPTER XV

WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo at the bottom
of Illinois where the Ohio River comes in and that was what we was
after  We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the
Ohio amongst the free States and then be out of trouble

Well the second night a fog begun to come on and we made for a towhead
to tie to for it wouldnt do to try to run in a fog but when I paddled
ahead in the canoe with the line to make fast there warnt anything but
little saplings to tie to  I passed the line around one of them right on
the edge of the cut bank but there was a stiff current and the raft
come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she
went  I see the fog closing down and it made me so sick and scared I
couldnt budge for most a half a minute it seemed to meand then there
warnt no raft in sight you couldnt see twenty yards  I jumped into
the canoe and run back to the stern and grabbed the paddle and set her
back a stroke  But she didnt come  I was in such a hurry I hadnt
untied her  I got up and tried to untie her but I was so excited my
hands shook so I couldnt hardly do anything with them

As soon as I got started I took out after the raft hot and heavy right
down the towhead  That was all right as far as it went but the towhead
warnt sixty yards long and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot
out into the solid white fog and hadnt no more idea which way I was
going than a dead man

Thinks I it wont do to paddle first I know Ill run into the bank or a
towhead or something I got to set still and float and yet its mighty
fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time  I
whooped and listened  Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop
and up comes my spirits  I went tearing after it listening sharp to
hear it again  The next time it come I see I warnt heading for it but
heading away to the right of it  And the next time I was heading away to
the left of itand not gaining on it much either for I was flying
around this way and that and tother but it was going straight ahead
all the time

I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan and beat it all the
time but he never did and it was the still places between the whoops
that was making the trouble for me  Well I fought along and directly I
hears the whoop BEHIND me  I was tangled good now  That was somebody
elses whoop or else I was turned around

I throwed the paddle down  I heard the whoop again it was behind me
yet but in a different place it kept coming and kept changing its
place and I kept answering till by and by it was in front of me again
and I knowed the current had swung the canoes head downstream and I
was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering  I
couldnt tell nothing about voices in a fog for nothing dont look
natural nor sound natural in a fog

The whooping went on and in about a minute I come abooming down on a
cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it and the current throwed me
off to the left and shot by amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared
the currrent was tearing by them so swift

In another second or two it was solid white and still again  I set
perfectly still then listening to my heart thump and I reckon I didnt
draw a breath while it thumped a hundred

I just give up then  I knowed what the matter was  That cut bank was an
island and Jim had gone down tother side of it  It warnt no towhead
that you could float by in ten minutes  It had the big timber of a
regular island it might be five or six miles long and more than half a
mile wide

I kept quiet with my ears cocked about fifteen minutes I reckon  I
was floating along of course four or five miles an hour but you dont
ever think of that  No you FEEL like you are laying dead still on the
water and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you dont think to
yourself how fast YOURE going but you catch your breath and think my
how that snags tearing along  If you think it aint dismal and lonesome
out in a fog that way by yourself in the night you try it onceyoull
see

Next for about a half an hour I whoops now and then at last I hears
the answer a long ways off and tries to follow it but I couldnt do it
and directly I judged Id got into a nest of towheads for I had little
dim glimpses of them on both sides of mesometimes just a narrow channel
between and some that I couldnt see I knowed was there because Id hear
the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung
over the banks  Well I warnt long loosing the whoops down amongst the
towheads and I only tried to chase them a little while anyway because
it was worse than chasing a Jackolantern  You never knowed a sound
dodge around so and swap places so quick and so much

I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times to
keep from knocking the islands out of the river and so I judged the raft
must be butting into the bank every now and then or else it would get
further ahead and clear out of hearingit was floating a little faster
than what I was

Well I seemed to be in the open river again by and by but I couldnt
hear no sign of a whoop nowheres  I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a
snag maybe and it was all up with him  I was good and tired so I laid
down in the canoe and said I wouldnt bother no more  I didnt want to
go to sleep of course but I was so sleepy I couldnt help it so I
thought I would take jest one little catnap

But I reckon it was more than a catnap for when I waked up the stars
was shining bright the fog was all gone and I was spinning down a big
bend stern first  First I didnt know where I was I thought I was
dreaming and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up
dim out of last week

It was a monstrous big river here with the tallest and the thickest kind
of timber on both banks just a solid wall as well as I could see by the
stars  I looked away downstream and seen a black speck on the water
I took after it but when I got to it it warnt nothing but a couple of
sawlogs made fast together  Then I see another speck and chased that
then another and this time I was right  It was the raft

When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his
knees asleep with his right arm hanging over the steeringoar  The
other oar was smashed off and the raft was littered up with leaves and
branches and dirt  So shed had a rough time

I made fast and laid down under Jims nose on the raft and began to gap
and stretch my fists out against Jim and says

Hello Jim have I been asleep  Why didnt you stir me up

Goodness gracious is dat you Huck  En you ain deadyou ain
drowndedyous back agin  Its too good for true honey its too
good for true Lemme look at you chile lemme feel o you  No you ain
dead yous back agin live en soun jis de same ole Huckde same ole
Huck thanks to goodness

Whats the matter with you Jim  You been adrinking

Drinkin  Has I ben adrinkin  Has I had a chance to be adrinkin

Well then what makes you talk so wild

How does I talk wild

HOW  Why haint you been talking about my coming back and all that
stuff as if Id been gone away

HuckHuck Finn you look me in de eye look me in de eye  HAINT you
ben gone away

Gone away  Why what in the nation do you mean  I haint been gone
anywheres  Where would I go to

Well looky here boss deys sumfn wrong dey is  Is I ME or who IS
I Is I heah or whah IS I  Now dats what I wants to know

Well I think youre here plain enough but I think youre a
tangleheaded old fool Jim

I is is I  Well you answer me dis  Didnt you tote out de line in de
canoe fer to make fas to de towhead

No I didnt  What towhead  I haint see no towhead

You haint seen no towhead  Looky here didnt de line pull loose en de
raf go ahummin down de river en leave you en de canoe behine in de
fog

What fog

Why de fogde fog dats been aroun all night  En didnt you whoop
en didnt I whoop tell we got mix up in de islands en one un us got
los en tother one was jis as good as los kase he didn know whah he
wuz En didnt I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible
time en mos git drownded  Now ain dat so bossaint it so  You
answer me dat

Well this is too many for me Jim  I haint seen no fog nor no
islands nor no troubles nor nothing  I been setting here talking with
you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago and I reckon
I done the same  You couldnt a got drunk in that time so of course
youve been dreaming

Dad fetch it how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes

Well hang it all you did dream it because there didnt any of it
happen

But Huck its all jis as plain to me as

It dont make no difference how plain it is there aint nothing in it
I know because Ive been here all the time

Jim didnt say nothing for about five minutes but set there studying
over it  Then he says

Well den I reckn I did dream it Huck but dog my cats ef it aint de
powerfullest dream I ever see  En I haint ever had no dream bfo dats
tired me like dis one

Oh well thats all right because a dream does tire a body like
everything sometimes  But this one was a staving dream tell me all
about it Jim

So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through just as it
happened only he painted it up considerable  Then he said he must start
in and terpret it because it was sent for a warning  He said the
first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good but the
current was another man that would get us away from him  The whoops was
warnings that would come to us every now and then and if we didnt try
hard to make out to understand them theyd just take us into bad luck
stead of keeping us out of it  The lot of towheads was troubles we was
going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks
but if we minded our business and didnt talk back and aggravate them we
would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river
which was the free States and wouldnt have no more trouble

It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft but it was
clearing up again now

Oh well thats all interpreted well enough as far as it goes Jim I
says but what does THESE things stand for

It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar  You could
see them firstrate now

Jim looked at the trash and then looked at me and back at the trash
again  He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he couldnt
seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right
away  But when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me
steady without ever smiling and says

What do dey stan for  Ise gwyne to tell you  When I got all wore out
wid work en wid de callin for you en went to sleep my heart wuz mos
broke bekase you wuz los en I didn kyer no mo what become er me en
de raf  En when I wake up en fine you back agin all safe en soun de
tears come en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo foot Is so
thankful En all you wuz thinkin bout wuz how you could make a fool uv
ole Jim wid a lie  Dat truck dah is TRASH en trash is what people is
dat puts dirt on de head er dey frens en makes em ashamed

Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam and went in there without
saying anything but that  But that was enough  It made me feel so mean
I could almost kissed HIS foot to get him to take it back

It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble
myself to a nigger but I done it and I warnt ever sorry for it
afterwards neither  I didnt do him no more mean tricks and I wouldnt
done that one if Id a knowed it would make him feel that way




CHAPTER XVI

WE slept most all day and started out at night a little ways behind a
monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession  She had
four long sweeps at each end so we judged she carried as many as thirty
men likely  She had five big wigwams aboard wide apart and an open
camp fire in the middle and a tall flagpole at each end  There was a
power of style about her  It AMOUNTED to something being a raftsman on
such a craft as that

We went drifting down into a big bend and the night clouded up and got
hot  The river was very wide and was walled with solid timber on both
sides you couldnt see a break in it hardly ever or a light  We talked
about Cairo and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it  I
said likely we wouldnt because I had heard say there warnt but about a
dozen houses there and if they didnt happen to have them lit up how
was we going to know we was passing a town  Jim said if the two big
rivers joined together there that would show  But I said maybe we might
think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old
river again That disturbed Jimand me too  So the question was what
to do  I said paddle ashore the first time a light showed and tell
them pap was behind coming along with a tradingscow and was a green
hand at the business and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo  Jim
thought it was a good idea so we took a smoke on it and waited

There warnt nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town and
not pass it without seeing it  He said hed be mighty sure to see it
because hed be a free man the minute he seen it but if he missed it
hed be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom  Every
little while he jumps up and says

Dah she is

But it warnt  It was Jackolanterns or lightning bugs so he set
down again and went to watching same as before  Jim said it made him
all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom  Well I can
tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish too to hear him
because I begun to get it through my head that he WAS most freeand who
was to blame for it  Why ME  I couldnt get that out of my conscience
no how nor no way It got to troubling me so I couldnt rest I couldnt
stay still in one place  It hadnt ever come home to me before what
this thing was that I was doing  But now it did and it stayed with me
and scorched me more and more  I tried to make out to myself that I
warnt to blame because I didnt run Jim off from his rightful owner
but it warnt no use conscience up and says every time But you knowed
he was running for his freedom and you could a paddled ashore and told
somebody  That was soI couldnt get around that noway  That was
where it pinched  Conscience says to me What had poor Miss Watson done
to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and
never say one single word  What did that poor old woman do to you that
you could treat her so mean  Why she tried to learn you your book she
tried to learn you your manners she tried to be good to you every way
she knowed how  THATS what she done

I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead  I
fidgeted up and down the raft abusing myself to myself and Jim was
fidgeting up and down past me  We neither of us could keep still  Every
time he danced around and says Dahs Cairo it went through me like a
shot and I thought if it WAS Cairo I reckoned I would die of
miserableness

Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself  He was
saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he
would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent and when he
got enough he would buy his wife which was owned on a farm close to
where Miss Watson lived and then they would both work to buy the two
children and if their master wouldnt sell them theyd get an
Ablitionist to go and steal them

It most froze me to hear such talk  He wouldnt ever dared to talk such
talk in his life before  Just see what a difference it made in him the
minute he judged he was about free  It was according to the old saying
Give a nigger an inch and hell take an ell  Thinks I this is what
comes of my not thinking  Here was this nigger which I had as good as
helped to run away coming right out flatfooted and saying he would
steal his childrenchildren that belonged to a man I didnt even know a
man that hadnt ever done me no harm

I was sorry to hear Jim say that it was such a lowering of him  My
conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever until at last I says
to it Let up on meit aint too late yetIll paddle ashore at the
first light and tell  I felt easy and happy and light as a feather
right off  All my troubles was gone  I went to looking out sharp for a
light and sort of singing to myself  By and by one showed  Jim sings
out

Wes safe Huck wes safe  Jump up and crack yo heels  Dats de good
ole Cairo at las I jis knows it

I says

Ill take the canoe and go and see Jim  It mightnt be you know

He jumped and got the canoe ready and put his old coat in the bottom for
me to set on and give me the paddle and as I shoved off he says

Pooty soon Ill be ashoutn for joy en Ill say its all on accounts
o Huck Is a free man en I couldnt ever ben free ef it hadn ben for
Huck Huck done it  Jim wont ever forgit you Huck yous de bes fren
Jims ever had en yous de ONLY fren ole Jims got now

I was paddling off all in a sweat to tell on him but when he says this
it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me  I went along slow
then and I warnt right down certain whether I was glad I started or
whether I warnt  When I was fifty yards off Jim says

Dah you goes de ole true Huck de ony white genlman dat ever kep his
promise to ole Jim

Well I just felt sick  But I says I GOT to do itI cant get OUT of
it  Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns and
they stopped and I stopped  One of them says

Whats that yonder

A piece of a raft I says

Do you belong on it

Yes sir

Any men on it

Only one sir

Well theres five niggers run off tonight up yonder above the head of
the bend  Is your man white or black

I didnt answer up prompt  I tried to but the words wouldnt come I
tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it but I warnt man
enoughhadnt the spunk of a rabbit  I see I was weakening so I just
give up trying and up and says

Hes white

I reckon well go and see for ourselves

I wish you would says I because its pap thats there and maybe
youd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is  Hes sickand so
is mam and Mary Ann

Oh the devil were in a hurry boy  But I spose weve got to  Come
buckle to your paddle and lets get along

I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars  When we had made a
stroke or two I says

Papll be mighty much obleeged to you I can tell you  Everybody goes
away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore and I cant do it
by myself

Well thats infernal mean  Odd too  Say boy whats the matter with
your father

Its theathewell it aint anything much

They stopped pulling  It warnt but a mighty little ways to the raft
now One says

Boy thats a lie  What IS the matter with your pap  Answer up square
now and itll be the better for you

I will sir I will honestbut dont leave us please  Its thethe
Gentlemen if youll only pull ahead and let me heave you the
headline you wont have to come anear the raftplease do

Set her back John set her back says one  They backed water  Keep
away boykeep to looard  Confound it I just expect the wind has
blowed it to us  Your paps got the smallpox and you know it precious
well  Why didnt you come out and say so  Do you want to spread it all
over

Well says I ablubbering Ive told everybody before and they just
went away and left us

Poor devil theres something in that  We are right down sorry for you
but wewell hang it we dont want the smallpox you see  Look here
Ill tell you what to do  Dont you try to land by yourself or youll
smash everything to pieces  You float along down about twenty miles and
youll come to a town on the lefthand side of the river  It will be
long after sunup then and when you ask for help you tell them your
folks are all down with chills and fever  Dont be a fool again and let
people guess what is the matter  Now were trying to do you a kindness
so you just put twenty miles between us thats a good boy  It wouldnt
do any good to land yonder where the light isits only a woodyard
Say I reckon your fathers poor and Im bound to say hes in pretty
hard luck  Here Ill put a twentydollar gold piece on this board and
you get it when it floats by  I feel mighty mean to leave you but my
kingdom it wont do to fool with smallpox dont you see

Hold on Parker says the other man heres a twenty to put on the
board for me  Goodbye boy you do as Mr Parker told you and youll
be all right

Thats so my boygoodbye goodbye  If you see any runaway niggers
you get help and nab them and you can make some money by it

Goodbye sir says I I wont let no runaway niggers get by me if I
can help it

They went off and I got aboard the raft feeling bad and low because I
knowed very well I had done wrong and I see it warnt no use for me to
try to learn to do right a body that dont get STARTED right when hes
little aint got no showwhen the pinch comes there aint nothing to
back him up and keep him to his work and so he gets beat  Then I
thought a minute and says to myself hold on spose youd a done right
and give Jim up would you felt better than what you do now  No says I
Id feel badId feel just the same way I do now  Well then says I
whats the use you learning to do right when its troublesome to do right
and aint no trouble to do wrong and the wages is just the same  I was
stuck  I couldnt answer that  So I reckoned I wouldnt bother no more
about it but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time

I went into the wigwam Jim warnt there  I looked all around he warnt
anywhere  I says

Jim

Here I is Huck  Is dey out o sight yit  Dont talk loud

He was in the river under the stern oar with just his nose out  I told
him they were out of sight so he come aboard  He says

I was alistenin to all de talk en I slips into de river en was gwyne
to shove for sho if dey come aboard  Den I was gwyne to swim to de raf
agin when dey was gone  But lawsy how you did fool em Huck  Dat WUZ
de smartes dodge  I tell you chile Ispec it save ole Jimole Jim
aint going to forgit you for dat honey

Then we talked about the money  It was a pretty good raisetwenty
dollars apiece  Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now
and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States
He said twenty mile more warnt far for the raft to go but he wished we
was already there

Towards daybreak we tied up and Jim was mighty particular about hiding
the raft good  Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles and
getting all ready to quit rafting

That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down
in a lefthand bend

I went off in the canoe to ask about it  Pretty soon I found a man out
in the river with a skiff setting a trotline  I ranged up and says

Mister is that town Cairo

Cairo no  You must be a blame fool

What town is it mister

If you want to know go and find out  If you stay here botherin around
me for about a half a minute longer youll get something you wont want

I paddled to the raft  Jim was awful disappointed but I said never
mind Cairo would be the next place I reckoned

We passed another town before daylight and I was going out again but it
was high ground so I didnt go  No high ground about Cairo Jim said
I had forgot it  We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to
the lefthand bank  I begun to suspicion something  So did Jim  I
says

Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night

He says

Doan les talk about it Huck  Po niggers cant have no luck  I
awluz spected dat rattlesnakeskin warnt done wid its work

I wish Id never seen that snakeskin JimI do wish Id never laid
eyes on it

It aint yo fault Huck you didn know  Dont you blame yoself bout
it

When it was daylight here was the clear Ohio water inshore sure enough
and outside was the old regular Muddy  So it was all up with Cairo

We talked it all over  It wouldnt do to take to the shore we couldnt
take the raft up the stream of course  There warnt no way but to wait
for dark and start back in the canoe and take the chances  So we slept
all day amongst the cottonwood thicket so as to be fresh for the work
and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone

We didnt say a word for a good while  There warnt anything to say  We
both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnakeskin so
what was the use to talk about it  It would only look like we was
finding fault and that would be bound to fetch more bad luckand keep
on fetching it too till we knowed enough to keep still

By and by we talked about what we better do and found there warnt no
way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a
canoe to go back in  We warnt going to borrow it when there warnt
anybody around the way pap would do for that might set people after us

So we shoved out after dark on the raft

Anybody that dont believe yet that its foolishness to handle a
snakeskin after all that that snakeskin done for us will believe
it now if they read on and see what more it done for us

The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore  But we
didnt see no rafts laying up so we went along during three hours and
more  Well the night got gray and ruther thick which is the next
meanest thing to fog  You cant tell the shape of the river and you
cant see no distance It got to be very late and still and then along
comes a steamboat up the river  We lit the lantern and judged she would
see it  Upstream boats didnt generly come close to us they go out and
follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs but nights like
this they bull right up the channel against the whole river

We could hear her pounding along but we didnt see her good till she was
close  She aimed right for us  Often they do that and try to see how
close they can come without touching sometimes the wheel bites off a
sweep and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs and thinks hes
mighty smart  Well here she comes and we said she was going to try and
shave us but she didnt seem to be sheering off a bit  She was a big
one and she was coming in a hurry too looking like a black cloud with
rows of glowworms around it but all of a sudden she bulged out big and
scary with a long row of wideopen furnace doors shining like redhot
teeth and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us  There
was a yell at us and a jingling of bells to stop the engines a powwow
of cussing and whistling of steamand as Jim went overboard on one side
and I on the other she come smashing straight through the raft

I divedand I aimed to find the bottom too for a thirtyfoot wheel had
got to go over me and I wanted it to have plenty of room  I could
always stay under water a minute this time I reckon I stayed under a
minute and a half  Then I bounced for the top in a hurry for I was
nearly busting  I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of
my nose and puffed a bit  Of course there was a booming current and of
course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped
them for they never cared much for raftsmen so now she was churning
along up the river out of sight in the thick weather though I could
hear her

I sung out for Jim about a dozen times but I didnt get any answer so I
grabbed a plank that touched me while I was treading water and struck
out for shore shoving it ahead of me  But I made out to see that the
drift of the current was towards the lefthand shore which meant that I
was in a crossing so I changed off and went that way

It was one of these long slanting twomile crossings so I was a good
long time in getting over  I made a safe landing and clumb up the bank
I couldnt see but a little ways but I went poking along over rough
ground for a quarter of a mile or more and then I run across a big
oldfashioned double loghouse before I noticed it  I was going to rush
by and get away but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and
barking at me and I knowed better than to move another peg




CHAPTER XVII

IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head
out and says

Be done boys  Whos there

I says

Its me

Whos me

George Jackson sir

What do you want

I dont want nothing sir  I only want to go along by but the dogs
wont let me

What are you prowling around here this time of night forhey

I warnt prowling around sir I fell overboard off of the steamboat

Oh you did did you  Strike a light there somebody  What did you say
your name was

George Jackson sir  Im only a boy

Look here if youre telling the truth you neednt be afraidnobodyll
hurt you  But dont try to budge stand right where you are  Rouse out
Bob and Tom some of you and fetch the guns  George Jackson is there
anybody with you

No sir nobody

I heard the people stirring around in the house now and see a light
The man sung out

Snatch that light away Betsy you old foolaint you got any sense
Put it on the floor behind the front door  Bob if you and Tom are
ready take your places

All ready

Now George Jackson do you know the Shepherdsons

No sir I never heard of them

Well that may be so and it maynt  Now all ready  Step forward
George Jackson  And mind dont you hurrycome mighty slow  If theres
anybody with you let him keep backif he shows himself hell be shot
Come along now  Come slow push the door open yourselfjust enough to
squeeze in d you hear

I didnt hurry I couldnt if Id a wanted to  I took one slow step at a
time and there warnt a sound only I thought I could hear my heart  The
dogs were as still as the humans but they followed a little behind me
When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and
unbarring and unbolting  I put my hand on the door and pushed it a
little and a little more till somebody said There thats enoughput
your head in I done it but I judged they would take it off

The candle was on the floor and there they all was looking at me and
me at them for about a quarter of a minute  Three big men with guns
pointed at me which made me wince I tell you the oldest gray and
about sixty the other two thirty or moreall of them fine and handsome
and the sweetest old grayheaded lady and back of her two young women
which I couldnt see right well  The old gentleman says

There I reckon its all right  Come in

As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it
and bolted it and told the young men to come in with their guns and
they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor and
got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows
there warnt none on the side  They held the candle and took a good
look at me and all said Why HE aint a Shepherdsonno there aint
any Shepherdson about him  Then the old man said he hoped I wouldnt
mind being searched for arms because he didnt mean no harm by itit
was only to make sure  So he didnt pry into my pockets but only felt
outside with his hands and said it was all right  He told me to make
myself easy and at home and tell all about myself but the old lady
says

Why bless you Saul the poor things as wet as he can be and dont
you reckon it may be hes hungry

True for you RachelI forgot

So the old lady says

Betsy this was a nigger woman you fly around and get him something
to eat as quick as you can poor thing and one of you girls go and wake
up Buck and tell himoh here he is himself  Buck take this little
stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of
yours thats dry

Buck looked about as old as methirteen or fourteen or along there
though he was a little bigger than me  He hadnt on anything but a
shirt and he was very frowzyheaded  He came in gaping and digging one
fist into his eyes and he was dragging a gun along with the other one
He says

Aint they no Shepherdsons around

They said no twas a false alarm

Well he says if theyd a ben some I reckon Id a got one

They all laughed and Bob says

Why Buck they might have scalped us all youve been so slow in
coming

Well nobody come after me and it aint right Im always kept down I
dont get no show

Never mind Buck my boy says the old man youll have show enough
all in good time dont you fret about that  Go long with you now and
do as your mother told you

When we got upstairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a
roundabout and pants of his and I put them on  While I was at it he
asked me what my name was but before I could tell him he started to tell
me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day
before yesterday and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went
out  I said I didnt know I hadnt heard about it before no way

Well guess he says

Howm I going to guess says I when I never heard tell of it before

But you can guess cant you  Its just as easy

WHICH candle  I says

Why any candle he says

I dont know where he was says I where was he

Why he was in the DARK  Thats where he was

Well if you knowed where he was what did you ask me for

Why blame it its a riddle dont you see  Say how long are you
going to stay here  You got to stay always  We can just have booming
timesthey dont have no school now  Do you own a dog  Ive got a
dogand hell go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in  Do
you like to comb up Sundays and all that kind of foolishness  You bet I
dont but ma she makes me  Confound these ole britches  I reckon Id
better put em on but Id ruther not its so warm  Are you all ready
All right  Come along old hoss

Cold cornpone cold cornbeef butter and buttermilkthat is what they
had for me down there and there aint nothing better that ever Ive come
across yet  Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes except the
nigger woman which was gone and the two young women  They all smoked
and talked and I eat and talked  The young women had quilts around
them and their hair down their backs  They all asked me questions and
I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm
down at the bottom of Arkansaw and my sister Mary Ann run off and got
married and never was heard of no more and Bill went to hunt them and he
warnt heard of no more and Tom and Mort died and then there warnt
nobody but just me and pap left and he was just trimmed down to nothing
on account of his troubles so when he died I took what there was left
because the farm didnt belong to us and started up the river deck
passage and fell overboard and that was how I come to be here  So they
said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it  Then it was most
daylight and everybody went to bed and I went to bed with Buck and when
I waked up in the morning drat it all I had forgot what my name was
So I laid there about an hour trying to think and when Buck waked up I
says

Can you spell Buck

Yes he says

I bet you cant spell my name says I

I bet you what you dare I can says he

All right says I go ahead

George Jaxonthere now he says

Well says I you done it but I didnt think you could  It aint no
slouch of a name to spellright off without studying

I set it down private because somebody might want ME to spell it next
and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to
it

It was a mighty nice family and a mighty nice house too  I hadnt seen
no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much
style  It didnt have an iron latch on the front door nor a wooden one
with a buckskin string but a brass knob to turn the same as houses in
town There warnt no bed in the parlor nor a sign of a bed but heaps
of parlors in towns has beds in them  There was a big fireplace that was
bricked on the bottom and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring
water on them and scrubbing them with another brick sometimes they wash
them over with red waterpaint that they call Spanishbrown same as they
do in town  They had big brass dogirons that could hold up a sawlog
There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece with a picture of a
town painted on the bottom half of the glass front and a round place in
the middle of it for the sun and you could see the pendulum swinging
behind it  It was beautiful to hear that clock tick and sometimes when
one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in
good shape she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she
got tuckered out  They wouldnt took any money for her

Well there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock made
out of something like chalk and painted up gaudy  By one of the parrots
was a cat made of crockery and a crockery dog by the other and when you
pressed down on them they squeaked but didnt open their mouths nor look
different nor interested  They squeaked through underneath  There was a
couple of big wildturkeywing fans spread out behind those things  On
the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery
basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it
which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is but
they warnt real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off
and showed the white chalk or whatever it was underneath

This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth with a red and
blue spreadeagle painted on it and a painted border all around  It
come all the way from Philadelphia they said  There was some books
too piled up perfectly exact on each corner of the table  One was a
big family Bible full of pictures  One was Pilgrims Progress about a
man that left his family it didnt say why  I read considerable in it
now and then  The statements was interesting but tough  Another was
Friendships Offering full of beautiful stuff and poetry but I didnt
read the poetry  Another was Henry Clays Speeches and another was Dr
Gunns Family Medicine which told you all about what to do if a body was
sick or dead  There was a hymn book and a lot of other books  And
there was nice splitbottom chairs and perfectly sound toonot bagged
down in the middle and busted like an old basket

They had pictures hung on the wallsmainly Washingtons and Lafayettes
and battles and Highland Marys and one called Signing the
Declaration There was some that they called crayons which one of the
daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen
years old  They was different from any pictures I ever see before
blacker mostly than is common  One was a woman in a slim black dress
belted small under the armpits with bulges like a cabbage in the middle
of the sleeves and a large black scoopshovel bonnet with a black veil
and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape and very wee black
slippers like a chisel and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on
her right elbow under a weeping willow and her other hand hanging down
her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule and underneath the
picture it said Shall I Never See Thee More Alas  Another one was a
young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head
and knotted there in front of a comb like a chairback and she was
crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her
other hand with its heels up and underneath the picture it said I Shall
Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas  There was one where a young
lady was at a window looking up at the moon and tears running down her
cheeks and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax
showing on one edge of it and she was mashing a locket with a chain to
it against her mouth and underneath the picture it said And Art Thou
Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas  These was all nice pictures I reckon but
I didnt somehow seem to take to them because if ever I was down a
little they always give me the fantods  Everybody was sorry she died
because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do and a body
could see by what she had done what they had lost  But I reckoned that
with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard  She
was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took
sick and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to
live till she got it done but she never got the chance  It was a
picture of a young woman in a long white gown standing on the rail of a
bridge all ready to jump off with her hair all down her back and
looking up to the moon with the tears running down her face and she had
two arms folded across her breast and two arms stretched out in front
and two more reaching up towards the moonand the idea was to see which
pair would look best and then scratch out all the other arms but as I
was saying she died before she got her mind made up and now they kept
this picture over the head of the bed in her room and every time her
birthday come they hung flowers on it  Other times it was hid with a
little curtain  The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice
sweet face but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery
seemed to me

This young girl kept a scrapbook when she was alive and used to paste
obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the
Presbyterian Observer and write poetry after them out of her own head
It was very good poetry  This is what she wrote about a boy by the name
of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded

ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS DECD

And did young Stephen sicken And did young Stephen die And did the sad
hearts thicken And did the mourners cry

No such was not the fate of Young Stephen Dowling Bots Though sad
hearts round him thickened Twas not from sickness shots

No whoopingcough did rack his frame Nor measles drear with spots Not
these impaired the sacred name Of Stephen Dowling Bots

Despised love struck not with woe That head of curly knots Nor stomach
troubles laid him low Young Stephen Dowling Bots

O no  Then list with tearful eye Whilst I his fate do tell His soul
did from this cold world fly By falling down a well

They got him out and emptied him Alas it was too late His spirit was
gone for to sport aloft In the realms of the good and great

If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was
fourteen there aint no telling what she could a done by and by  Buck
said she could rattle off poetry like nothing  She didnt ever have to
stop to think  He said she would slap down a line and if she couldnt
find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down
another one and go ahead She warnt particular she could write about
anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful
Every time a man died or a woman died or a child died she would be on
hand with her tribute before he was cold  She called them tributes
The neighbors said it was the doctor first then Emmeline then the
undertakerthe undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once and
then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead persons name which was
Whistler  She warnt ever the same after that she never complained but
she kinder pined away and did not live long  Poor thing manys the time
I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out
her poor old scrapbook and read in it when her pictures had been
aggravating me and I had soured on her a little  I liked all that
family dead ones and all and warnt going to let anything come between
us  Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was
alive and it didnt seem right that there warnt nobody to make some
about her now she was gone so I tried to sweat out a verse or two
myself but I couldnt seem to make it go somehow  They kept Emmelines
room trim and nice and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked
to have them when she was alive and nobody ever slept there  The old
lady took care of the room herself though there was plenty of niggers
and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly

Well as I was saying about the parlor there was beautiful curtains on
the windows  white with pictures painted on them of castles with vines
all down the walls and cattle coming down to drink  There was a little
old piano too that had tin pans in it I reckon and nothing was ever
so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing The Last Link is Broken and
play The Battle of Prague on it  The walls of all the rooms was
plastered and most had carpets on the floors and the whole house was
whitewashed on the outside

It was a double house and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and
floored and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day
and it was a cool comfortable place  Nothing couldnt be better  And
warnt the cooking good and just bushels of it too




CHAPTER XVIII

COL  GRANGERFORD was a gentleman you see  He was a gentleman all over
and so was his family  He was well born as the saying is and thats
worth as much in a man as it is in a horse so the Widow Douglas said
and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town
and pap he always said it too though he warnt no more quality than a
mudcat himself  Col  Grangerford was very tall and very slim and had a
darkishpaly complexion not a sign of red in it anywheres he was clean
shaved every morning all over his thin face and he had the thinnest kind
of lips and the thinnest kind of nostrils and a high nose and heavy
eyebrows and the blackest kind of eyes sunk so deep back that they
seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you as you may say  His
forehead was high and his hair was black and straight and hung to his
shoulders His hands was long and thin and every day of his life he put
on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so
white it hurt your eyes to look at it and on Sundays he wore a blue
tailcoat with brass buttons on it  He carried a mahogany cane with a
silver head to it  There warnt no frivolishness about him not a bit
and he warnt ever loud  He was as kind as he could beyou could feel
that you know and so you had confidence  Sometimes he smiled and it
was good to see but when he straightened himself up like a libertypole
and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows you
wanted to climb a tree first and find out what the matter was
afterwards  He didnt ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners
everybody was always goodmannered where he was  Everybody loved to have
him around too he was sunshine most alwaysI mean he made it seem
like good weather  When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for
half a minute and that was enough there wouldnt nothing go wrong again
for a week

When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up
out of their chairs and give them goodday and didnt set down again
till they had set down  Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the
decanter was and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him and he
held it in his hand and waited till Toms and Bobs was mixed and then
they bowed and said Our duty to you sir and madam and THEY bowed
the least bit in the world and said thank you and so they drank all
three and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the
mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers and give
it to me and Buck and we drank to the old people too

Bob was the oldest and Tom nexttall beautiful men with very broad
shoulders and brown faces and long black hair and black eyes  They
dressed in white linen from head to foot like the old gentleman and
wore broad Panama hats

Then there was Miss Charlotte she was twentyfive and tall and proud
and grand but as good as she could be when she warnt stirred up but
when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks like
her father  She was beautiful

So was her sister Miss Sophia but it was a different kind  She was
gentle and sweet like a dove and she was only twenty

Each person had their own nigger to wait on themBuck too  My nigger
had a monstrous easy time because I warnt used to having anybody do
anything for me but Bucks was on the jump most of the time

This was all there was of the family now but there used to be more
three sons they got killed and Emmeline that died

The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers
Sometimes a stack of people would come there horseback from ten or
fifteen mile around and stay five or six days and have such junketings
round about and on the river and dances and picnics in the woods
daytimes and balls at the house nights  These people was mostly
kinfolks of the family  The men brought their guns with them  It was a
handsome lot of quality I tell you

There was another clan of aristocracy around therefive or six families
mostly of the name of Shepherdson  They was as hightoned and well
born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords  The Shepherdsons
and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing which was about two
mile above our house so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our
folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses

One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting and heard a horse
coming  We was crossing the road  Buck says

Quick  Jump for the woods

We done it and then peeped down the woods through the leaves  Pretty
soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road setting his horse
easy and looking like a soldier  He had his gun across his pommel  I
had seen him before  It was young Harney Shepherdson  I heard Bucks
gun go off at my ear and Harneys hat tumbled off from his head  He
grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid  But we
didnt wait  We started through the woods on a run  The woods warnt
thick so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet and twice I seen
Harney cover Buck with his gun and then he rode away the way he cometo
get his hat I reckon but I couldnt see  We never stopped running till
we got home  The old gentlemans eyes blazed a minutetwas pleasure
mainly I judgedthen his face sort of smoothed down and he says
kind of gentle

I dont like that shooting from behind a bush  Why didnt you step into
the road my boy

The Shepherdsons dont father  They always take advantage

Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling
his tale and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped  The two young
men looked dark but never said nothing  Miss Sophia she turned pale
but the color come back when she found the man warnt hurt

Soon as I could get Buck down by the corncribs under the trees by
ourselves I says

Did you want to kill him Buck

Well I bet I did

What did he do to you

Him  He never done nothing to me

Well then what did you want to kill him for

Why nothingonly its on account of the feud

Whats a feud

Why where was you raised  Dont you know what a feud is

Never heard of it beforetell me about it

Well says Buck a feud is this way  A man has a quarrel with another
man and kills him then that other mans brother kills HIM then the
other brothers on both sides goes for one another then the COUSINS
chip inand by and by everybodys killed off and there aint no more
feud  But its kind of slow and takes a long time

Has this one been going on long Buck

Well I should RECKON  It started thirty year ago or somers along
there  There was trouble bout something and then a lawsuit to settle
it and the suit went agin one of the men and so he up and shot the man
that won the suitwhich he would naturally do of course  Anybody
would

What was the trouble about Buckland

I reckon maybeI dont know

Well who done the shooting  Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson

Laws how do I know  It was so long ago

Dont anybody know

Oh yes pa knows I reckon and some of the other old people but they
dont know now what the row was about in the first place

Has there been many killed Buck

Yes right smart chance of funerals  But they dont always kill  Pas
got a few buckshot in him but he dont mind it cuz he dont weigh much
anyway  Bobs been carved up some with a bowie and Toms been hurt once
or twice

Has anybody been killed this year Buck

Yes we got one and they got one  Bout three months ago my cousin Bud
fourteen year old was riding through the woods on tother side of the
river and didnt have no weapon with him which was blame foolishness
and in a lonesome place he hears a horse acoming behind him and sees
old Baldy Shepherdson alinkin after him with his gun in his hand and
his white hair aflying in the wind and stead of jumping off and taking
to the brush Bud lowed he could outrun him so they had it nip and
tuck for five mile or more the old man againing all the time so at
last Bud seen it warnt any use so he stopped and faced around so as to
have the bullet holes in front you know and the old man he rode up and
shot him down  But he didnt git much chance to enjoy his luck for
inside of a week our folks laid HIM out

I reckon that old man was a coward Buck

I reckon he WARNT a coward  Not by a blame sight  There aint a
coward amongst them Shepherdsonsnot a one  And there aint no cowards
amongst the Grangerfords either  Why that old man kep up his end in a
fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords and come out
winner  They was all ahorseback he lit off of his horse and got behind
a little woodpile and kep his horse before him to stop the bullets but
the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man
and peppered away at him and he peppered away at them  Him and his
horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled but the Grangerfords had
to be FETCHED homeand one of em was dead and another died the next
day  No sir if a bodys out hunting for cowards he dont want to fool
away any time amongst them Shepherdsons becuz they dont breed any of
that KIND

Next Sunday we all went to church about three mile everybody
ahorseback The men took their guns along so did Buck and kept them
between their knees or stood them handy against the wall  The
Shepherdsons done the same  It was pretty ornery preachingall about
brotherly love and suchlike tiresomeness but everybody said it was a
good sermon and they all talked it over going home and had such a
powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and
preforeordestination and I dont know what all that it did seem to me
to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet

About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around some in their
chairs and some in their rooms and it got to be pretty dull  Buck and a
dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep  I went up to
our room and judged I would take a nap myself  I found that sweet Miss
Sophia standing in her door which was next to ours and she took me in
her room and shut the door very soft and asked me if I liked her and I
said I did and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell
anybody and I said I would  Then she said shed forgot her Testament
and left it in the seat at church between two other books and would I
slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her and not say nothing to
nobody  I said I would So I slid out and slipped off up the road and
there warnt anybody at the church except maybe a hog or two for there
warnt any lock on the door and hogs likes a puncheon floor in
summertime because its cool  If you notice most folks dont go
to church only when theyve got to but a hog is different

Says I to myself somethings up it aint natural for a girl to be in
such a sweat about a Testament  So I give it a shake and out drops a
little piece of paper with HALFPAST TWO wrote on it with a pencil  I
ransacked it but couldnt find anything else  I couldnt make anything
out of that so I put the paper in the book again and when I got home
and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me  She
pulled me in and shut the door then she looked in the Testament till she
found the paper and as soon as she read it she looked glad and before a
body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze and said I was the
best boy in the world and not to tell anybody  She was mighty red in
the face for a minute and her eyes lighted up and it made her powerful
pretty  I was a good deal astonished but when I got my breath I asked
her what the paper was about and she asked me if I had read it and I
said no and she asked me if I could read writing and I told her no
only coarsehand and then she said the paper warnt anything but a
bookmark to keep her place and I might go and play now

I went off down to the river studying over this thing and pretty soon I
noticed that my nigger was following along behind  When we was out of
sight of the house he looked back and around a second and then comes
arunning and says

Mars Jawge if youll come down into de swamp Ill show you a whole
stack o watermoccasins

Thinks I thats mighty curious he said that yesterday  He oughter know
a body dont love watermoccasins enough to go around hunting for them
What is he up to anyway  So I says

All right trot ahead

I followed a half a mile then he struck out over the swamp and waded
ankle deep as much as another halfmile  We come to a little flat piece
of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines and
he says

You shove right in dah jist a few steps Mars Jawge dahs whah dey is
Is seed m befo I dont kyer to see em no mo

Then he slopped right along and went away and pretty soon the trees hid
him  I poked into the place aways and come to a little open patch as
big as a bedroom all hung around with vines and found a man laying there
asleepand by jings it was my old Jim

I waked him up and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him
to see me again but it warnt  He nearly cried he was so glad but he
warnt surprised  Said he swum along behind me that night and heard me
yell every time but dasnt answer because he didnt want nobody to pick
HIM up and take him into slavery again  Says he

I got hurt a little en couldnt swim fas so I wuz a considable ways
behine you towards de las when you landed I reckned I could ketch up

Yes he is  He aint ever told me you was here told me to come and
hed show me a lot of watermoccasins  If anything happens HE aint
mixed up in it  He can say he never seen us together and it ll be the
truth

I dont want to talk much about the next day  I reckon Ill cut it
pretty short  I waked up about dawn and was agoing to turn over and go
to sleep again when I noticed how still it wasdidnt seem to be anybody
stirring  That warnt usual  Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone
Well I gets up awondering and goes down stairsnobody around
everything as still as a mouse  Just the same outside  Thinks I what
does it mean  Down by the woodpile I comes across my Jack and says

Whats it all about

Says he

Dont you know Mars Jawge

No says I I dont

Well den Miss Sophias run off deed she has  She run off in de

road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him fo he kin git acrost
de river wid Miss Sophia  I reckn deys gwyne to be mighty rough
times

Buck went off thout waking me up

Well I reckn he DID  Dey warnt gwyne to mix you up in it  Mars Buck
he loaded up his gun en lowed hes gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or
bust Well deyll be plenty un m dah I reckn en you bet you hell
fetch one ef he gits a chanst

I took up the river road as hard as I could put  By and by I begin to
hear guns a good ways off  When I cOme in sight of the log store and the
woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees and
brush till I got to a good place and then I clumb up into the forks of a
cottonwood that was out of reach and watched  There was a woodrank
four foot high a little ways in front of the tree and first I was going
to hide behind that but maybe it was luckier I didnt

There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open
place before the log store cussing and yelling and trying to get at a
couple of young chaps that was behind the woodrank alongside of the
steamboat landing but they couldnt come it  Every time one of them
showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at  The two
boys was squatting back to back behind the pile so they could watch both
ways

By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling  They started
riding towards the store then up gets one of the boys draws a steady
bead over the woodrank and drops one of them out of his saddle  All
the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started
to carry him to the store and that minute the two boys started on the
run  They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed
Then the men see them and jumped on their horses and took out after
them  They gained on the boys but it didnt do no good the boys had
too good a start they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree
and slipped in behind it and so they had the bulge on the men again
One of the boys was Buck and the other was a slim young chap about
nineteen years old

The men ripped around awhile and then rode away  As soon as they was
out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him  He didnt know what to
make of my voice coming out of the tree at first  He was awful
surprised  He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men
come in sight again said they was up to some devilment or other
wouldnt be gone long  I wished I was out of that tree but I dasnt
come down  Buck begun to cry and rip and lowed that him and his cousin
Joe that was the other young chap would make up for this day yet  He
said his father and his two brothers was killed and two or three of the
enemy  Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush  Buck said his
father and brothers ought to waited for their relationsthe Shepherdsons
was too strong for them  I asked him what was become of young Harney and
Miss Sophia  He said theyd got across the river and was safe  I was
glad of that but the way Buck did take on because he didnt manage to
kill Harney that day he shot at himI haint ever heard anything like
it

All of a sudden bang bang bang goes three or four gunsthe men had
slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their
horses  The boys jumped for the riverboth of them hurtand as they
swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and
singing out Kill them kill them  It made me so sick I most fell out
of the tree  I aint agoing to tell ALL that happenedit would make me
sick again if I was to do that  I wished I hadnt ever come ashore that
night to see such things  I aint ever going to get shut of themlots
of times I dream about them

I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark afraid to come down
Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods and twice I seen little
gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns so I reckoned the
trouble was still agoing on  I was mighty downhearted so I made up my
mind I wouldnt ever go anear that house again because I reckoned I was
to blame somehow I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss
Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at halfpast two and run off and I
judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way
she acted and then maybe he would a locked her up and this awful mess
wouldnt ever happened

When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a
piece and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water and
tugged at them till I got them ashore then I covered up their faces and
got away as quick as I could  I cried a little when I was covering up
Bucks face for he was mighty good to me

It was just dark now  I never went near the house but struck through
the woods and made for the swamp  Jim warnt on his island so I tramped
off in a hurry for the crick and crowded through the willows redhot to
jump aboard and get out of that awful country  The raft was gone  My
souls but I was scared  I couldnt get my breath for most a minute
Then I raised a yell  A voice not twentyfive foot from me says

Good lan is dat you honey  Doan make no noise

It was Jims voicenothing ever sounded so good before  I run along the
bank a piece and got aboard and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me he was
so glad to see me  He says

Laws bless you chile I uz right down sho yous dead agin  Jacks
been heah he say he reckn yous ben shot kase you didn come home no
mo so Is jes dis minute a startin de raf down towards de mouf er de
crick sos to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack comes
agin en tells me for certain you IS dead  Lawsy Is mighty glad to git
you back again honey

I says

All rightthats mighty good they wont find me and theyll think
Ive been killed and floated down the rivertheres something up there
that ll help them think soso dont you lose no time Jim but just
shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can

I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the
middle of the Mississippi  Then we hung up our signal lantern and
judged that we was free and safe once more  I hadnt had a bite to eat
since yesterday so Jim he got out some corndodgers and buttermilk and
pork and cabbage and greensthere aint nothing in the world so good
when its cooked rightand whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a
good time  I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds and so was
Jim to get away from the swamp  We said there warnt no home like a
raft after all  Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery but a
raft dont  You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft




CHAPTER XIX

TWO or three days and nights went by I reckon I might say they swum by
they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely  Here is the way we put
in the time  It was a monstrous big river down theresometimes a mile
and a half wide we run nights and laid up and hid daytimes soon as
night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied upnearly always in
the dead water under a towhead and then cut young cottonwoods and
willows and hid the raft with them  Then we set out the lines  Next we
slid into the river and had a swim so as to freshen up and cool off
then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep
and watched the daylight come  Not a sound anywheresperfectly still
just like the whole world was asleep only sometimes the bullfrogs
acluttering maybe  The first thing to see looking away over the water
was a kind of dull linethat was the woods on tother side you couldnt
make nothing else out then a pale place in the sky then more paleness
spreading around then the river softened up away off and warnt black
any more but gray you could see little dark spots drifting along ever
so far awaytrading scows and such things and long black streaks
rafts sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking or jumbled up voices
it was so still and sounds come so far and by and by you could see a
streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that theres
a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak
look that way and you see the mist curl up off of the water and the
east reddens up and the river and you make out a logcabin in the edge
of the woods away on the bank on tother side of the river being a
woodyard likely and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through
it anywheres then the nice breeze springs up and comes fanning you from
over there so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods
and the flowers but sometimes not that way because theyve left dead
fish laying around gars and such and they do get pretty rank and next
youve got the full day and everything smiling in the sun and the
songbirds just going it

A little smoke couldnt be noticed now so we would take some fish off of
the lines and cook up a hot breakfast  And afterwards we would watch the
lonesomeness of the river and kind of lazy along and by and by lazy off
to sleep  Wake up by and by and look to see what done it and maybe see
a steamboat coughing along upstream so far off towards the other side
you couldnt tell nothing about her only whether she was a sternwheel or
sidewheel then for about an hour there wouldnt be nothing to hear nor
nothing to seejust solid lonesomeness  Next youd see a raft sliding
by away off yonder and maybe a galoot on it chopping because theyre
most always doing it on a raft youd see the axe flash and come down
you dont hear nothing you see that axe go up again and by the time
its above the mans head then you hear the KCHUNKit had took all
that time to come over the water  So we would put in the day lazying
around listening to the stillness  Once there was a thick fog and the
rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats
wouldnt run over them  A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear
them talking and cussing and laughingheard them plain but we couldnt
see no sign of them it made you feel crawly it was like spirits
carrying on that way in the air  Jim said he believed it was spirits
but I says

No spirits wouldnt say Dern the dern fog

Soon as it was night out we shoved when we got her out to about the
middle we let her alone and let her float wherever the current wanted
her to then we lit the pipes and dangled our legs in the water and
talked about all kinds of thingswe was always naked day and night
whenever the mosquitoes would let usthe new clothes Bucks folks made
for me was too good to be comfortable and besides I didnt go much on
clothes nohow

Sometimes wed have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest
time Yonder was the banks and the islands across the water and maybe a
sparkwhich was a candle in a cabin window and sometimes on the water
you could see a spark or twoon a raft or a scow you know and maybe
you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts
Its lovely to live on a raft  We had the sky up there all speckled
with stars and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them and
discuss about whether they was made or only just happened  Jim he
allowed they was made but I allowed they happened I judged it would
have took too long to MAKE so many  Jim said the moon could a LAID them
well that looked kind of reasonable so I didnt say nothing against it
because Ive seen a frog lay most as many so of course it could be done
We used to watch the stars that fell too and see them streak down  Jim
allowed theyd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest

Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the
dark and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of
her chimbleys and they would rain down in the river and look awful
pretty then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and
her powwow shut off and leave the river still again and by and by her
waves would get to us a long time after she was gone and joggle the
raft a bit and after that you wouldnt hear nothing for you couldnt
tell how long except maybe frogs or something

After midnight the people on shore went to bed and then for two or three
hours the shores was blackno more sparks in the cabin windows  These
sparks was our clockthe first one that showed again meant morning was
coming so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away

One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to
the main shoreit was only two hundred yardsand paddled about a mile
up a crick amongst the cypress woods to see if I couldnt get some
berries Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed
the crick here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as
they could foot it  I thought I was a goner for whenever anybody was
after anybody I judged it was MEor maybe Jim  I was about to dig out
from there in a hurry but they was pretty close to me then and sung out
and begged me to save their livessaid they hadnt been doing nothing
and was being chased for itsaid there was men and dogs acoming  They
wanted to jump right in but I says

Dont you do it  I dont hear the dogs and horses yet youve got time
to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways then you
take to the water and wade down to me and get inthatll throw the dogs
off the scent

They done it and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead and
in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off
shouting We heard them come along towards the crick but couldnt see
them they seemed to stop and fool around a while then as we got
further and further away all the time we couldnt hardly hear them at
all by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the
river everything was quiet and we paddled over to the towhead and hid
in the cottonwoods and was safe

One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards and had a bald head
and very gray whiskers  He had an old batteredup slouch hat on and a
greasy blue woollen shirt and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed
into his boottops and homeknit gallusesno he only had one  He had
an old longtailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over
his arm and both of them had big fat rattylooking carpetbags

The other fellow was about thirty and dressed about as ornery  After
breakfast we all laid off and talked and the first thing that come out
was that these chaps didnt know one another

What got you into trouble says the baldhead to tother chap

Well Id been selling an article to take the tartar off the teethand
it does take it off too and generly the enamel along with itbut I
stayed about one night longer than I ought to and was just in the act of
sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town and you
told me they were coming and begged me to help you to get off  So I
told you I was expecting trouble myself and would scatter out WITH you
Thats the whole yarnwhats yourn

Well Id ben arunning a little temperance revival thar bout a week
and was the pet of the women folks big and little for I was makin it
mighty warm for the rummies I TELL you and takin as much as five or
six dollars a nightten cents a head children and niggers freeand
business agrowin all the time when somehow or another a little report
got around last night that I had a way of puttin in my time with a
private jug on the sly  A nigger rousted me out this mornin and told
me the people was getherin on the quiet with their dogs and horses and
theyd be along pretty soon and give me bout half an hours start and
then run me down if they could and if they got me theyd tar and feather
me and ride me on a rail sure  I didnt wait for no breakfastI warnt
hungry

Nobody never said anything for a while then the young man hove a sigh
and says

Alas

What re you alassin about says the baldhead

To think I should have lived to be leading such a life and be degraded
down into such company  And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with
a rag

Dern your skin aint the company good enough for you says the
baldhead pretty pert and uppish

Yes it IS good enough for me its as good as I deserve for who
fetched me so low when I was so high  I did myself  I dont blame YOU
gentlemenfar from it I dont blame anybody  I deserve it all  Let

Jims eyes bugged out when he heard that and I reckon mine did too
Then the baldhead says  No you cant mean it

Yes  My greatgrandfather eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater fled
to this country about the end of the last century to breathe the pure
air of freedom married here and died leaving a son his own father
dying about the same time  The second son of the late duke seized the
titles and estatesthe infant real duke was ignored  I am the lineal
descendant of that infantI am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater and
here am I forlorn torn from my high estate hunted of men despised by
the cold world ragged worn heartbroken and degraded to the
companionship of felons on a raft

Jim pitied him ever so much and so did I We tried to comfort him but
he said it warnt much use he couldnt be much comforted said if we was
a mind to acknowledge him that would do him more good than most anything
else so we said we would if he would tell us how  He said we ought to
bow when we spoke to him and say Your Grace or My Lord or Your
Lordshipand he wouldnt mind it if we called him plain
Bridgewater which he said was a title anyway and not a name and
one of us ought to wait on him at dinner and do any little thing for him
he wanted done

Well that was all easy so we done it  All through dinner Jim stood
around and waited on him and says Will yo Grace have some o dis or
some o dat and so on and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to
him

But the old man got pretty silent by and bydidnt have much to say and
didnt look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on
around that duke  He seemed to have something on his mind  So along in
the afternoon he says

Looky here Bilgewater he says Im nation sorry for you but you
aint the only person thats had troubles like that

No

No you aint  You aint the only person thats ben snaked down
wrongfully outn a high place

Alas

No you aint the only person thats had a secret of his birth  And
by jings HE begins to cry

Hold  What do you mean

Bilgewater kin I trust you says the old man still sort of sobbing

To the bitter death  He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it
and says That secret of your being  speak

Bilgewater I am the late Dauphin

You bet you Jim and me stared this time  Then the duke says

You are what

Yes my friend it is too trueyour eyes is lookin at this very moment
on the pore disappeared Dauphin Looy the Seventeen son of Looy the
Sixteen and Marry Antonette

You  At your age  No  You mean youre the late Charlemagne you must
be six or seven hundred years old at the very least

Trouble has done it Bilgewater trouble has done it trouble has brung
these gray hairs and this premature balditude  Yes gentlemen you see
before you in blue jeans and misery the wanderin exiled trampledon
and sufferin rightful King of France

Well he cried and took on so that me and Jim didnt know hardly what to
do we was so sorryand so glad and proud wed got him with us too  So
we set in like we done before with the duke and tried to comfort HIM
But he said it warnt no use nothing but to be dead and done with it all
could do him any good though he said it often made him feel easier and
better for a while if people treated him according to his rights and got
down on one knee to speak to him and always called him Your Majesty
and waited on him first at meals and didnt set down in his presence
till he asked them So Jim and me set to majestying him and doing this
and that and tother for him and standing up till he told us we might
set down  This done him heaps of good and so he got cheerful and
comfortable  But the duke kind of soured on him and didnt look a bit
satisfied with the way things was going still the king acted real
friendly towards him and said the dukes greatgrandfather and all the
other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by HIS father and
was allowed to come to the palace considerable but the duke stayed huffy
a good while till by and by the king says

Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this hyer raft
Bilgewater and so whats the use o your bein sour  It ll only make
things oncomfortable  It aint my fault I warnt born a duke it aint
your fault you warnt born a kingso whats the use to worry  Make the
best o things the way you find em says Ithats my motto  This aint
no bad thing that weve struck hereplenty grub and an easy lifecome
give us your hand duke and les all be friends

The duke done it and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it  It took away
all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it because it
would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft
for what you want above all things on a raft is for everybody to be
satisfied and feel right and kind towards the others

It didnt take me long to make up my mind that these liars warnt no
kings nor dukes at all but just lowdown humbugs and frauds  But I
never said nothing never let on kept it to myself its the best way
then you dont have no quarrels and dont get into no trouble  If they
wanted us to call them kings and dukes I hadnt no objections long as
it would keep peace in the family and it warnt no use to tell Jim so I
didnt tell him  If I never learnt nothing else out of pap I learnt
that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them
have their own way




CHAPTER XX

THEY asked us considerable many questions wanted to know what we covered
up the raft that way for and laid by in the daytime instead of running
was Jim a runaway nigger  Says I

Goodness sakes would a runaway nigger run SOUTH

No they allowed he wouldnt  I had to account for things some way so I
says

My folks was living in Pike County in Missouri where I was born and
they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike  Pa he lowed hed
break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben whos got a little
onehorse place on the river fortyfour mile below Orleans  Pa was
pretty poor and had some debts so when hed squared up there warnt
nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger Jim  That warnt enough
to take us fourteen hundred mile deck passage nor no other way  Well
when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day he ketched this
piece of a raft so we reckoned wed go down to Orleans on it  Pas luck
didnt hold out a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one
night and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel Jim and me
come up all right but pa was drunk and Ike was only four years old so
they never come up no more  Well for the next day or two we had
considerable trouble because people was always coming out in skiffs and
trying to take Jim away from me saying they believed he was a runaway
nigger  We dont run daytimes no more now nights they dont bother us

The duke says

Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we
want to  Ill think the thing overIll invent a plan thatll fix it
Well let it alone for today because of course we dont want to go by
that town yonder in daylightit mightnt be healthy

Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain the heat
lightning was squirting around low down in the sky and the leaves was
beginning to shiverit was going to be pretty ugly it was easy to see
that  So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam to see
what the beds was like  My bed was a straw tick better than Jims which
was a cornshuck tick theres always cobs around about in a shuck tick
and they poke into you and hurt and when you roll over the dry shucks
sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves it makes such a
rustling that you wake up  Well the duke allowed he would take my bed
but the king allowed he wouldnt  He says

I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that
a cornshuck bed warnt just fitten for me to sleep on  Your Grace ll
take the shuck bed yourself

Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute being afraid there was
going to be some more trouble amongst them so we was pretty glad when
the duke says

Tis my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of
oppression  Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit I yield I
submit tis my fate  I am alone in the worldlet me suffer can bear
it

We got away as soon as it was good and dark  The king told us to stand
well out towards the middle of the river and not show a light till we
got a long ways below the town  We come in sight of the little bunch of
lights by and bythat was the town you knowand slid by about a half
a mile out all right  When we was threequarters of a mile below we
hoisted up our signal lantern and about ten oclock it come on to rain
and blow and thunder and lighten like everything so the king told us to
both stay on watch till the weather got better then him and the duke
crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night  It was my watch
below till twelve but I wouldnt a turned in anyway if Id had a bed
because a body dont see such a storm as that every day in the week not
by a long sight  My souls how the wind did scream along  And every
second or two thered come a glare that lit up the whitecaps for a half
a mile around and youd see the islands looking dusty through the rain
and the trees thrashing around in the wind then comes a HWHACKbum
bum bumbleumbleumbumbumbumbumand the thunder would go rumbling
and grumbling away and quitand then RIP comes another flash and
another sockdolager  The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes
but I hadnt any clothes on and didnt mind  We didnt have no trouble
about snags the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant
that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or
that and miss them

I had the middle watch you know but I was pretty sleepy by that time
so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me he was always
mighty good that way Jim was  I crawled into the wigwam but the king
and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warnt no show for
me so I laid outsideI didnt mind the rain because it was warm and
the waves warnt running so high now  About two they come up again
though and Jim was going to call me but he changed his mind because he
reckoned they warnt high enough yet to do any harm but he was mistaken
about that for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper
and washed me overboard  It most killed Jim alaughing  He was the
easiest nigger to laugh that ever was anyway

I took the watch and Jim he laid down and snored away and by and by the
storm let up for good and all and the first cabinlight that showed I
rousted him out and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day

The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast and him and
the duke played sevenup a while five cents a game  Then they got tired
of it and allowed they would lay out a campaign as they called it
The duke went down into his carpetbag and fetched up a lot of little
printed bills and read them out loud  One bill said The celebrated Dr
Armand de Montalban of Paris would lecture on the Science of
Phrenology at such and such a place on the blank day of blank at ten
cents admission and furnish charts of character at twentyfive cents
apiece  The duke said that was HIM  In another bill he was the
worldrenowned Shakespearian tragedian Garrick the Younger of Drury
Lane London  In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other
wonderful things like finding water and gold with a diviningrod
dissipating witch spells and so on  By and by he says

But the histrionic muse is the darling  Have you ever trod the boards
Royalty

No says the king

You shall then before youre three days older Fallen Grandeur says
the duke  The first good town we come to well hire a hall and do the
sword fight in Richard III and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet
How does that strike you

Im in up to the hub for anything that will pay Bilgewater but you
see I dont know nothing about playactin and haint ever seen much of
it  I was too small when pap used to have em at the palace  Do you
reckon you can learn me

Easy

All right  Im jist afreezn for something fresh anyway  Les
commence right away

So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was and
said he was used to being Romeo so the king could be Juliet

But if Juliets such a young gal duke my peeled head and my white
whiskers is goin to look oncommon odd on her maybe

No dont you worry these country jakes wont ever think of that
Besides you know youll be in costume and that makes all the
difference in the world Juliets in a balcony enjoying the moonlight
before she goes to bed and shes got on her nightgown and her ruffled
nightcap  Here are the costumes for the parts

He got out two or three curtaincalico suits which he said was meedyevil
armor for Richard III and tother chap and a long white cotton
nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match  The king was satisfied so
the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid
spreadeagle way prancing around and acting at the same time to show
how it had got to be done then he give the book to the king and told him
to get his part by heart

There was a little onehorse town about three mile down the bend and
after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run
in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim so he allowed he would
go down to the town and fix that thing  The king allowed he would go
too and see if he couldnt strike something  We was out of coffee so
Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some

When we got there there warnt nobody stirring streets empty and
perfectly dead and still like Sunday  We found a sick nigger sunning
himself in a back yard and he said everybody that warnt too young or
too sick or too old was gone to campmeeting about two mile back in the
woods  The king got the directions and allowed hed go and work that
campmeeting for all it was worth and I might go too

The duke said what he was after was a printingoffice  We found it a
little bit of a concern up over a carpenter shopcarpenters and
printers all gone to the meeting and no doors locked  It was a dirty
litteredup place and had ink marks and handbills with pictures of
horses and runaway niggers on them all over the walls  The duke shed
his coat and said he was all right now  So me and the king lit out for
the campmeeting

We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping for it was a most
awful hot day  There was as much as a thousand people there from twenty
mile around  The woods was full of teams and wagons hitched
everywheres feeding out of the wagontroughs and stomping to keep off
the flies  There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with
branches where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell and piles of
watermelons and green corn and suchlike truck

The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds only they was
bigger and held crowds of people  The benches was made out of outside
slabs of logs with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into
for legs They didnt have no backs  The preachers had high platforms to
stand on at one end of the sheds  The women had on sunbonnets and some
had linseywoolsey frocks some gingham ones and a few of the young ones
had on calico  Some of the young men was barefooted and some of the
children didnt have on any clothes but just a towlinen shirt  Some of
the old women was knitting and some of the young folks was courting on
the sly

The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn  He lined
out two lines everybody sung it and it was kind of grand to hear it
there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way then he
lined out two more for them to singand so on  The people woke up more
and more and sung louder and louder and towards the end some begun to
groan and some begun to shout  Then the preacher begun to preach and
begun in earnest too and went weaving first to one side of the platform
and then the other and then aleaning down over the front of it with
his arms and his body going all the time and shouting his words out with
all his might and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and
spread it open and kind of pass it around this way and that shouting
Its the brazen serpent in the wilderness  Look upon it and live  And
people would shout out GloryAaMEN  And so he went on and the
people groaning and crying and saying amen

Oh come to the mourners bench come black with sin AMEN come
sick and sore AMEN come lame and halt and blind AMEN come pore
and needy sunk in shame AAMEN come all thats worn and soiled and
sufferingcome with a broken spirit come with a contrite heart come
in your rags and sin and dirt the waters that cleanse is free the door
of heaven stands openoh enter in and be at rest AAMEN  GLORY
GLORY HALLELUJAH

And so on  You couldnt make out what the preacher said any more on
account of the shouting and crying  Folks got up everywheres in the
crowd and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners bench
with the tears running down their faces and when all the mourners had
got up there to the front benches in a crowd they sung and shouted and
flung themselves down on the straw just crazy and wild

Well the first I knowed the king got agoing and you could hear him
over everybody and next he went acharging up on to the platform and
the preacher he begged him to speak to the people and he done it  He
told them he was a piratebeen a pirate for thirty years out in the
Indian Oceanand his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in
a fight and he was home now to take out some fresh men and thanks to
goodness hed been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat
without a cent and he was glad of it it was the blessedest thing that
ever happened to him because he was a changed man now and happy for the
first time in his life and poor as he was he was going to start right
off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean and put in the rest of his
life trying to turn the pirates into the true path for he could do it
better than anybody else being acquainted with all pirate crews in that
ocean and though it would take him a long time to get there without
money he would get there anyway and every time he convinced a pirate he
would say to him Dont you thank me dont you give me no credit it
all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville campmeeting natural
brothers and benefactors of the race and that dear preacher there the
truest friend a pirate ever had

And then he busted into tears and so did everybody  Then somebody sings
out Take up a collection for him take up a collection  Well a half
a dozen made a jump to do it but somebody sings out Let HIM pass the
hat around  Then everybody said it the preacher too

So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes
and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so
good to the poor pirates away off there and every little while the
prettiest kind of girls with the tears running down their cheeks would
up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by and he
always done it and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or
six timesand he was invited to stay a week and everybody wanted him to
live in their houses and said theyd think it was an honor but he said
as this was the last day of the campmeeting he couldnt do no good and
besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to
work on the pirates

When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had
collected eightyseven dollars and seventyfive cents  And then he had
fetched away a threegallon jug of whisky too that he found under a
wagon when he was starting home through the woods  The king said take
it all around it laid over any day hed ever put in in the missionarying
line  He said it warnt no use talking heathens dont amount to shucks
alongside of pirates to work a campmeeting with

The duke was thinking HED been doing pretty well till the king come to
show up but after that he didnt think so so much  He had set up and
printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printingofficehorse
billsand took the money four dollars  And he had got in ten
dollars worth of advertisements for the paper which he said he would
put in for four dollars if they would pay in advanceso they done it
The price of the paper was two dollars a year but he took in three
subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in
advance they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual but he
said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as
he could afford it and was going to run it for cash  He set up a little
piece of poetry which he made himself out of his own headthree
verseskind of sweet and saddishthe name of it was Yes crush cold
world this breaking heartand he left that all set up and ready to
print in the paper and didnt charge nothing for it  Well he took in
nine dollars and a half and said hed done a pretty square days work
for it

Then he showed us another little job hed printed and hadnt charged for
because it was for us  It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a
bundle on a stick over his shoulder and 200 reward under it  The
reading was all about Jim and just described him to a dot  It said he
run away from St Jacques plantation forty mile below New Orleans last
winter and likely went north and whoever would catch him and send him
back he could have the reward and expenses

Now says the duke after tonight we can run in the daytime if we
want to  Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot
with a rope and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we
captured him up the river and were too poor to travel on a steamboat so
we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to
get the reward  Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim but
it wouldnt go well with the story of us being so poor  Too much like
jewelry  Ropes are the correct thingwe must preserve the unities as
we say on the boards

We all said the duke was pretty smart and there couldnt be no trouble
about running daytimes  We judged we could make miles enough that night
to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the dukes work in the
printing office was going to make in that little town then we could boom
right along if we wanted to

We laid low and kept still and never shoved out till nearly ten oclock
then we slid by pretty wide away from the town and didnt hoist our
lantern till we was clear out of sight of it

When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning he says

Huck does you reckn we gwyne to run acrost any mo kings on dis trip

No I says I reckon not

Well says he dats all right den  I doan mine one er two kings
but dats enough  Dis ones powerful drunk en de duke ain much
better

I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French so he could hear
what it was like but he said he had been in this country so long and
had so much trouble hed forgot it




CHAPTER XXI

IT was after sunup now but we went right on and didnt tie up  The
king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty but after
theyd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal
After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft and
pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches and let his legs dangle
in the water so as to be comfortable and lit his pipe and went to
getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart  When he had got it pretty good
him and the duke begun to practice it together  The duke had to learn
him over and over again how to say every speech and he made him sigh
and put his hand on his heart and after a while he said he done it
pretty well only he says you mustnt bellow out ROMEO that way
like a bullyou must say it soft and sick and languishy soRoomeo
that is the idea for Juliets a dear sweet mere child of a girl you
know and she doesnt bray like a jackass

Well next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of
oak laths and begun to practice the sword fightthe duke called himself
Richard III and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was
grand to see  But by and by the king tripped and fell overboard and
after that they took a rest and had a talk about all kinds of adventures
theyd had in other times along the river

After dinner the duke says

Well Capet well want to make this a firstclass show you know so I
guess well add a little more to it  We want a little something to
answer encores with anyway

Whats onkores Bilgewater

The duke told him and then says

Ill answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailors hornpipe and
youwell let me seeoh Ive got ityou can do Hamlets soliloquy

Hamlets which

Hamlets soliloquy you know the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare
Ah its sublime sublime  Always fetches the house  I havent got it
in the bookIve only got one volumebut I reckon I can piece it out
from memory  Ill just walk up and down a minute and see if I can call
it back from recollections vaults

So he went to marching up and down thinking and frowning horrible every
now and then then he would hoist up his eyebrows next he would squeeze
his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan next he would
sigh and next hed let on to drop a tear  It was beautiful to see him
By and by he got it  He told us to give attention  Then he strikes a
most noble attitude with one leg shoved forwards and his arms stretched
away up and his head tilted back looking up at the sky and then he
begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth and after that all through
his speech he howled and spread around and swelled up his chest and
just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before  This is the
speechI learned it easy enough while he was learning it to the king

To be or not to be that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of so
long life For who would fardels bear till Birnam Wood do come to
Dunsinane But that the fear of something after death Murders the
innocent sleep Great natures second course And makes us rather sling
the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of
Theres the respect must give us pause Wake Duncan with thy knocking  I
would thou couldst For who would bear the whips and scorns of time The
oppressors wrong the proud mans contumely The laws delay and the
quietus which his pangs might take In the dead waste and middle of the
night when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black But that
the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns Breathes
forth contagion on the world And thus the native hue of resolution like
the poor cat i the adage Is sicklied oer with care And all the clouds
that lowered oer our housetops With this regard their currents turn
awry And lose the name of action Tis a consummation devoutly to be
wished  But soft you the fair Ophelia Ope not thy ponderous and marble
jaws But get thee to a nunnerygo

Well the old man he liked that speech and he mighty soon got it so he
could do it firstrate  It seemed like he was just born for it and when
he had his hand in and was excited it was perfectly lovely the way he
would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off

The first chance we got the duke he had some showbills printed and after
that for two or three days as we floated along the raft was a most
uncommon lively place for there warnt nothing but sword fighting and
rehearsingas the duke called itgoing on all the time  One morning
when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw we come in sight of a
little onehorse town in a big bend so we tied up about threequarters
of a mile above it in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a
tunnel by the cypress trees and all of us but Jim took the canoe and
went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our
show

We struck it mighty lucky there was going to be a circus there that
afternoon and the country people was already beginning to come in in
all kinds of old shackly wagons and on horses  The circus would leave
before night so our show would have a pretty good chance  The duke he
hired the courthouse and we went around and stuck up our bills  They
read like this

Then we went loafing around town  The stores and houses was most all
old shackly dried up frame concerns that hadnt ever been painted they
was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts so as to be out of
reach of the water when the river was overflowed  The houses had little
gardens around them but they didnt seem to raise hardly anything in
them but jimpsonweeds and sunflowers and ash piles and old curledup
boots and shoes and pieces of bottles and rags and playedout tinware
The fences was made of different kinds of boards nailed on at different
times and they leaned every which way and had gates that didnt generly
have but one hingea leather one  Some of the fences had been
whitewashed some time or another but the duke said it was in Clumbus
time like enough  There was generly hogs in the garden and people
driving them out

All the stores was along one street  They had white domestic awnings in
front and the country people hitched their horses to the awningposts
There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings and loafers roosting on
them all day long whittling them with their Barlow knives and chawing
tobacco and gaping and yawning and stretchinga mighty ornery lot
They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella but
didnt wear no coats nor waistcoats they called one another Bill and
Buck and Hank and Joe and Andy and talked lazy and drawly and used
considerable many cuss words  There was as many as one loafer leaning up
against every awningpost and he most always had his hands in his
britchespockets except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of
tobacco or scratch  What a body was hearing amongst them all the time
was

Gimme a chaw v tobacker Hank

Caint I haint got but one chaw left  Ask Bill

Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw maybe he lies and says he aint got none
Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world nor a chaw
of tobacco of their own  They get all their chawing by borrowing they
say to a fellow I wisht youd len me a chaw Jack I jist this minute
give Ben Thompson the last chaw I hadwhich is a lie pretty much
everytime it dont fool nobody but a stranger but Jack aint no
stranger so he says

YOU give him a chaw did you  So did your sisters cats grandmother
You pay me back the chaws youve awready borryd offn me Lafe Buckner
then Ill loan you one or two ton of it and wont charge you no back
intrust nuther

Well I DID pay you back some of it wunst

Yes you didbout six chaws  You borryd store tobacker and paid back
niggerhead

Store tobacco is flat black plug but these fellows mostly chaws the
natural leaf twisted  When they borrow a chaw they dont generly cut it
off with a knife but set the plug in between their teeth and gnaw with
their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two
then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when
its handed back and says sarcastic

Here gimme the CHAW and you take the PLUG

All the streets and lanes was just mud they warnt nothing else BUT mud
mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places and two
or three inches deep in ALL the places  The hogs loafed and grunted
around everywheres  Youd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come
lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way where
folks had to walk around her and shed stretch out and shut her eyes and
wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her and look as happy as if
she was on salary And pretty soon youd hear a loafer sing out Hi  SO
boy sick him Tige and away the sow would go squealing most horrible
with a dog or two swinging to each ear and three or four dozen more
acoming and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing
out of sight and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise  Then
theyd settle back again till there was a dog fight  There couldnt
anything wake them up all over and make them happy all over like a dog
fightunless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting
fire to him or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to
death

On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank and
they was bowed and bent and about ready to tumble in The people had
moved out of them  The bank was caved away under one corner of some
others and that corner was hanging over  People lived in them yet but
it was dangersome because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house
caves in at a time  Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep
will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the
river in one summer Such a town as that has to be always moving back
and back and back because the rivers always gnawing at it

The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons
and horses in the streets and more coming all the time  Families
fetched their dinners with them from the country and eat them in the
wagons  There was considerable whisky drinking going on and I seen
three fights  By and by somebody sings out

Here comes old Boggsin from the country for his little old monthly
drunk here he comes boys

All the loafers looked glad I reckoned they was used to having fun out
of Boggs  One of them says

Wonder who hes agwyne to chaw up this time  If hed achawed up all
the men hes ben agwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year hed have
considerable ruputation now

Another one says I wisht old Boggs d threaten me cuz then Id know I
warnt gwyne to die for a thousan year

Boggs comes atearing along on his horse whooping and yelling like an
Injun and singing out

Cler the track thar  Im on the wawpath and the price uv coffins is
agwyne to raise

He was drunk and weaving about in his saddle he was over fifty year
old and had a very red face  Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him
and sassed him and he sassed back and said hed attend to them and lay
them out in their regular turns but he couldnt wait now because hed
come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn and his motto was Meat
first and spoon vittles to top off on

He see me and rode up and says

Whard you come fm boy  You prepared to die

Then he rode on  I was scared but a man says

He dont mean nothing hes always acarryin on like that when hes
drunk  Hes the best naturedest old fool in Arkansawnever hurt nobody
drunk nor sober

Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town and bent his head down so
he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells

Come out here Sherburn Come out and meet the man youve swindled
Youre the houn Im after and Im agwyne to have you too

And so he went on calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue
to and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and
going on  By and by a proudlooking man about fiftyfiveand he was a
heap the best dressed man in that town toosteps out of the store and
the crowd drops back on each side to let him come  He says to Boggs
mighty cam and slowhe says

Im tired of this but Ill endure it till one oclock  Till one
oclock mindno longer  If you open your mouth against me only once
after that time you cant travel so far but I will find you

Then he turns and goes in  The crowd looked mighty sober nobody
stirred and there warnt no more laughing  Boggs rode off blackguarding
Sherburn as loud as he could yell all down the street and pretty soon
back he comes and stops before the store still keeping it up  Some men
crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up but he wouldnt they
told him it would be one oclock in about fifteen minutes and so he MUST
go homehe must go right away  But it didnt do no good  He cussed
away with all his might and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode
over it and pretty soon away he went araging down the street again
with his gray hair aflying Everybody that could get a chance at him
tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up
and get him sober but it warnt no useup the street he would tear
again and give Sherburn another cussing  By and by somebody says

Go for his daughterquick go for his daughter sometimes hell listen
to her  If anybody can persuade him she can

So somebody started on a run  I walked down street a ways and stopped
In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again but not on his
horse  He was areeling across the street towards me bareheaded with
a friend on both sides of him aholt of his arms and hurrying him along
He was quiet and looked uneasy and he warnt hanging back any but was
doing some of the hurrying himself  Somebody sings out

Boggs

I looked over there to see who said it and it was that Colonel Sherburn
He was standing perfectly still in the street and had a pistol raised in
his right handnot aiming it but holding it out with the barrel tilted
up towards the sky  The same second I see a young girl coming on the
run and two men with her  Boggs and the men turned round to see who
called him and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side and
the pistolbarrel come down slow and steady to a levelboth barrels
cocked Boggs throws up both of his hands and says O Lord dont
shoot  Bang goes the first shot and he staggers back clawing at the
airbang goes the second one and he tumbles backwards on to the
ground heavy and solid with his arms spread out  That young girl
screamed out and comes rushing and down she throws herself on her
father crying and saying Oh hes killed him hes killed him  The
crowd closed up around them and shouldered and jammed one another with
their necks stretched trying to see and people on the inside trying to
shove them back and shouting Back back give him air give him air

Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground and turned around
on his heels and walked off

They took Boggs to a little drug store the crowd pressing around just
the same and the whole town following and I rushed and got a good place
at the window where I was close to him and could see in  They laid him
on the floor and put one large Bible under his head and opened another
one and spread it on his breast but they tore open his shirt first and
I seen where one of the bullets went in  He made about a dozen long
gasps his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath and
letting it down again when he breathed it outand after that he laid
still he was dead  Then they pulled his daughter away from him
screaming and crying and took her off  She was about sixteen and very
sweet and gentle looking but awful pale and scared

Well pretty soon the whole town was there squirming and scrouging and
pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look but people that
had the places wouldnt give them up and folks behind them was saying
all the time Say now youve looked enough you fellows taint right
and taint fair for you to stay thar all the time and never give nobody
a chance other folks has their rights as well as you

There was considerable jawing back so I slid out thinking maybe there
was going to be trouble  The streets was full and everybody was
excited Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened
and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows
stretching their necks and listening  One long lanky man with long
hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head and a
crookedhandled cane marked out the places on the ground where Boggs
stood and where Sherburn stood and the people following him around from
one place to tother and watching everything he done and bobbing their
heads to show they understood and stooping a little and resting their
hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his
cane and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood
frowning and having his hatbrim down over his eyes and sung out
Boggs and then fetched his cane down slow to a level and says Bang
staggered backwards says Bang again and fell down flat on his back
The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect said it was
just exactly the way it all happened  Then as much as a dozen people got
out their bottles and treated him

Well by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched  In about a
minute everybody was saying it so away they went mad and yelling and
snatching down every clothesline they come to to do the hanging with




CHAPTER XXII

THEY swarmed up towards Sherburns house awhooping and raging like
Injuns and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped
to mush and it was awful to see  Children was heeling it ahead of the
mob screaming and trying to get out of the way and every window along
the road was full of womens heads and there was nigger boys in every
tree and bucks and wenches looking over every fence and as soon as the
mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of
reach  Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on scared most
to death

They swarmed up in front of Sherburns palings as thick as they could jam
together and you couldnt hear yourself think for the noise  It was a
little twentyfoot yard  Some sung out Tear down the fence tear down
the fence  Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing
and down she goes and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like
a wave

Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch
with a doublebarrel gun in his hand and takes his stand perfectly cam
and deliberate not saying a word  The racket stopped and the wave
sucked back

Sherburn never said a wordjust stood there looking down  The
stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable  Sherburn run his eye slow
along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to
outgaze him but they couldnt they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed not the pleasant kind but the
kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread thats got sand
in it

Then he says slow and scornful

The idea of YOU lynching anybody  Its amusing  The idea of you
thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a MAN  Because youre brave
enough to tar and feather poor friendless castout women that come along
here did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a
MAN  Why a MANS safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kindas
long as its daytime and youre not behind him

Do I know you  I know you clear through was born and raised in the
South and Ive lived in the North so I know the average all around
The average mans a coward  In the North he lets anybody walk over him
that wants to and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it
In the South one man all by himself has stopped a stage full of men in
the daytime and robbed the lot  Your newspapers call you a brave people
so much that you think you are braver than any other peoplewhereas
youre just AS brave and no braver  Why dont your juries hang
murderers  Because theyre afraid the mans friends will shoot them in
the back in the darkand its just what they WOULD do

So they always acquit and then a MAN goes in the night with a hundred
masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal  Your mistake is that
you didnt bring a man with you thats one mistake and the other is
that you didnt come in the dark and fetch your masks  You brought PART
of a manBuck Harkness thereand if you hadnt had him to start you
youd a taken it out in blowing

You didnt want to come  The average man dont like trouble and danger
YOU dont like trouble and danger  But if only HALF a manlike Buck
Harkness thereshouts Lynch him lynch him youre afraid to back
downafraid youll be found out to be what you areCOWARDSand so
you raise a yell and hang yourselves on to that halfamans coattail
and come raging up here swearing what big things youre going to do
The pitifulest thing out is a mob thats what an army isa mob they
dont fight with courage thats born in them but with courage thats
borrowed from their mass and from their officers  But a mob without any
MAN at the head of it is BENEATH pitifulness  Now the thing for YOU to
do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole  If any real
lynchings going to be done it will be done in the dark Southern
fashion and when they come theyll bring their masks and fetch a MAN
along  Now LEAVEand take your halfaman with youtossing his gun up
across his left arm and cocking it when he says this

The crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing
off every which way and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them looking
tolerable cheap  I could a stayed if I wanted to but I didnt want to

I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman
went by and then dived in under the tent  I had my twentydollar gold
piece and some other money but I reckoned I better save it because
there aint no telling how soon you are going to need it away from home
and amongst strangers that way  You cant be too careful  I aint
opposed to spending money on circuses when there aint no other way but
there aint no use in WASTING it on them

It was a real bully circus  It was the splendidest sight that ever was
when they all come riding in two and two a gentleman and lady side by
side the men just in their drawers and undershirts and no shoes nor
stirrups and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable
there must a been twenty of themand every lady with a lovely
complexion and perfectly beautiful and looking just like a gang of real
sureenough queens and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars
and just littered with diamonds  It was a powerful fine sight I never
see anything so lovely  And then one by one they got up and stood and
went aweaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful the men
looking ever so tall and airy and straight with their heads bobbing and
skimming along away up there under the tentroof and every ladys
roseleafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips and she looking
like the most loveliest parasol

And then faster and faster they went all of them dancing first one foot
out in the air and then the other the horses leaning more and more and
the ringmaster going round and round the centerpole cracking his whip
and shouting Hihi and the clown cracking jokes behind him and by
and by all hands dropped the reins and every lady put her knuckles on
her hips and every gentleman folded his arms and then how the horses did
lean over and hump themselves  And so one after the other they all
skipped off into the ring and made the sweetest bow I ever see and then
scampered out and everybody clapped their hands and went just about
wild

Well all through the circus they done the most astonishing things and
all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people  The
ringmaster couldnt ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick
as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said and how he ever
COULD think of so many of them and so sudden and so pat was what I
couldnt noway understand Why I couldnt a thought of them in a year
And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ringsaid he wanted to
ride said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was  They argued
and tried to keep him out but he wouldnt listen and the whole show
come to a standstill  Then the people begun to holler at him and make
fun of him and that made him mad and he begun to rip and tear so that
stirred up the people and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the
benches and swarm towards the ring saying Knock him down throw him
out and one or two women begun to scream  So then the ringmaster he
made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldnt be no disturbance
and if the man would promise he wouldnt make no more trouble he would
let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse  So everybody
laughed and said all right and the man got on The minute he was on the
horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around with two circus
men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him and the drunk man
hanging on to his neck and his heels flying in the air every jump and
the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears
rolled down  And at last sure enough all the circus men could do the
horse broke loose and away he went like the very nation round and round
the ring with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck with
first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side and then tother
one on tother side and the people just crazy  It warnt funny to me
though I was all of a tremble to see his danger  But pretty soon he
struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle areeling this way and
that and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood
and the horse agoing like a house afire too  He just stood up there
asailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warnt ever drunk in his
lifeand then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them  He shed
them so thick they kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed
seventeen suits And then there he was slim and handsome and dressed
the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw and he lit into that horse with
his whip and made him fairly humand finally skipped off and made his
bow and danced off to the dressingroom and everybody just ahowling
with pleasure and astonishment

Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled and he WAS the sickest
ringmaster you ever see I reckon  Why it was one of his own men  He
had got up that joke all out of his own head and never let on to nobody
Well I felt sheepish enough to be took in so but I wouldnt a been in
that ringmasters place not for a thousand dollars  I dont know there
may be bullier circuses than what that one was but I never struck them
yet Anyways it was plenty good enough for ME and wherever I run across
it it can have all of MY custom every time

Well that night we had OUR show but there warnt only about twelve
people therejust enough to pay expenses  And they laughed all the
time and that made the duke mad and everybody left anyway before the
show was over but one boy which was asleep  So the duke said these
Arkansaw lunkheads couldnt come up to Shakespeare what they wanted was
low comedyand maybe something ruther worse than low comedy he
reckoned  He said he could size their style  So next morning he got
some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint and drawed off
some handbills and stuck them up all over the village  The bills said

AT THE COURT HOUSE FOR 3 NIGHTS ONLY
The WorldRenowned Tragedians

AND EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER
Of the London and
Continental Theatres
In their Thrilling Tragedy of
THE KINGS CAMELEOPARD
OR THE ROYAL NONESUCH   
Admission 50 cents

Then at the bottom was the biggest line of all which said

LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED

There says he if that line dont fetch them I dont know Arkansaw




CHAPTER XXIII

WELL all day him and the king was hard at it rigging up a stage and a
curtain and a row of candles for footlights and that night the house was
jam full of men in no time  When the place couldnt hold no more the
duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the
stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech and
praised up this tragedy and said it was the most thrillingest one that
ever was and so he went on abragging about the tragedy and about
Edmund Kean the Elder which was to play the main principal part in it
and at last when hed got everybodys expectations up high enough he
rolled up the curtain and the next minute the king come aprancing out
on all fours naked and he was painted all over ringstreakedand
striped all sorts of colors as splendid as a rainbow  Andbut never
mind the rest of his outfit it was just wild but it was awful funny
The people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done
capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and
stormed and hawhawed till he come back and done it over again and after
that they made him do it another time Well it would make a cow laugh to
see the shines that old idiot cut

Then the duke he lets the curtain down and bows to the people and says
the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more on accounts of
pressing London engagements where the seats is all sold already for it
in Drury Lane and then he makes them another bow and says if he has
succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them he will be deeply
obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come
and see it

Twenty people sings out

What is it over  Is that ALL

The duke says yes  Then there was a fine time  Everybody sings out
Sold and rose up mad and was agoing for that stage and them
tragedians  But a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts

Hold on  Just a word gentlemen  They stopped to listen  We are
soldmighty badly sold  But we dont want to be the laughing stock of
this whole town I reckon and never hear the last of this thing as long
as we live  NO  What we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this
show up and sell the REST of the town  Then well all be in the same
boat  Aint that sensible You bet it isthe jedge is right
everybody sings out All right thennot a word about any sell  Go
along home and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy

Next day you couldnt hear nothing around that town but how splendid that
show was  House was jammed again that night and we sold this crowd the
same way  When me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all
had a supper and by and by about midnight they made Jim and me back
her out and float her down the middle of the river and fetch her in and
hide her about two mile below town

The third night the house was crammed againand they warnt newcomers
this time but people that was at the show the other two nights  I stood
by the duke at the door and I see that every man that went in had his
pockets bulging or something muffled up under his coatand I see it
warnt no perfumery neither not by a long sight  I smelt sickly eggs
by the barrel and rotten cabbages and such things and if I know the
signs of a dead cat being around and I bet I do there was sixtyfour of
them went in  I shoved in there for a minute but it was too various for
me I couldnt stand it  Well when the place couldnt hold no more
people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for
him a minute and then he started around for the stage door I after him
but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says

Walk fast now till you get away from the houses and then shin for the
raft like the dickens was after you

I done it and he done the same  We struck the raft at the same time
and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and
still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience
but nothing of the sort pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam
and says

Well howd the old thing pan out this time duke  He hadnt been
uptown at all

We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village
Then we lit up and had a supper and the king and the duke fairly laughed
their bones loose over the way theyd served them people  The duke says

Greenhorns flatheads  I knew the first house would keep mum and let
the rest of the town get roped in and I knew theyd lay for us the third
night and consider it was THEIR turn now  Well it IS their turn and
Id give something to know how much theyd take for it  I WOULD just
like to know how theyre putting in their opportunity  They can turn it
into a picnic if they want tothey brought plenty provisions

Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixtyfive dollars in that
three nights  I never see money hauled in by the wagonload like that
before  By and by when they was asleep and snoring Jim says

Dont it sprise you de way dem kings carries on Huck

No I says it dont

Why dont it Huck

Well it dont because its in the breed  I reckon theyre all alike

But Huck dese kings o ourn is reglar rapscallions dats jist what
dey is deys reglar rapscallions

Well thats what Im asaying all kings is mostly rapscallions as fur
as I can make out

Is dat so

You read about them onceyoull see  Look at Henry the Eight this n
s a Sundayschool Superintendent to HIM  And look at Charles Second
and Louis Fourteen and Louis Fifteen and James Second and Edward
Second and Richard Third and forty more besides all them Saxon
heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain  My
you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom  He WAS a
blossom  He used to marry a new wife every day and chop off her head
next morning  And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was
ordering up eggs  Fetch up Nell Gwynn he says  They fetch her up
Next morning Chop off her head  And they chop it off  Fetch up Jane
Shore he says and up she comes Next morning Chop off her headand
they chop it off  Ring up Fair Rosamun  Fair Rosamun answers the
bell  Next morning Chop off her head  And he made every one of them
tell him a tale every night and he kept that up till he had hogged a
thousand and one tales that way and then he put them all in a book and
called it Domesday Bookwhich was a good name and stated the case  You
dont know kings Jim but I know them and this old rip of ourn is one
of the cleanest Ive struck in history  Well Henry he takes a notion he
wants to get up some trouble with this country How does he go at it
give noticegive the country a show  No  All of a sudden he heaves
all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard and whacks out a declaration of
independence and dares them to come on  That was HIS stylehe never
give anybody a chance  He had suspicions of his father the Duke of
Wellington  Well what did he do  Ask him to show up  Nodrownded
him in a butt of mamsey like a cat  Spose people left money laying
around where he waswhat did he do  He collared it  Spose he
contracted to do a thing and you paid him and didnt set down there and
see that he done itwhat did he do  He always done the other thing
Spose he opened his mouthwhat then  If he didnt shut it up powerful
quick hed lose a lie every time  Thats the kind of a bug Henry was
and if wed a had him along stead of our kings hed a fooled that town a
heap worse than ourn done  I dont say that ourn is lambs because they
aint when you come right down to the cold facts but they aint nothing
to THAT old ram anyway  All I say is kings is kings and you got to
make allowances  Take them all around theyre a mighty ornery lot
Its the way theyre raised

But dis one do SMELL so like de nation Huck

Well they all do Jim  We cant help the way a king smells history
dont tell no way

Now de duke hes a tolerble likely man in some ways

Yes a dukes different  But not very different  This ones a middling
hard lot for a duke  When hes drunk there aint no nearsighted man
could tell him from a king

Well anyways I doan hanker for no mo un um Huck  Dese is all I kin
stan

Its the way I feel too Jim  But weve got them on our hands and we
got to remember what they are and make allowances  Sometimes I wish we
could hear of a country thats out of kings

What was the use to tell Jim these warnt real kings and dukes  It
wouldnt a done no good and besides it was just as I said  you
couldnt tell them from the real kind

I went to sleep and Jim didnt call me when it was my turn  He often
done that  When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with
his head down betwixt his knees moaning and mourning to himself  I
didnt take notice nor let on  I knowed what it was about  He was
thinking about his wife and his children away up yonder and he was low
and homesick because he hadnt ever been away from home before in his
life and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white
folks does for theirn  It dont seem natural but I reckon its so  He
was often moaning and mourning that way nights when he judged I was
asleep and saying Po little Lizabeth po little Johnny its mighty
hard I spec I aint ever gwyne to see you no mo no mo  He was a
mighty good nigger Jim was

But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young
ones and by and by he says

What makes me feel so bad dis time uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder
on de bank like a whack er a slam while ago en it mine me er de time I

CHAPTER XXIV

NEXT day towards night we laid up under a little willow towhead out in
the middle where there was a village on each side of the river and the
duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns  Jim he
spoke to the duke and said he hoped it wouldnt take but a few hours
because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all
day in the wigwam tied with the rope  You see when we left him all
alone we had to tie him because if anybody happened on to him all by
himself and not tied it wouldnt look much like he was a runaway nigger
you know So the duke said it WAS kind of hard to have to lay roped all
day and hed cipher out some way to get around it

He was uncommon bright the duke was and he soon struck it  He dressed
Jim up in King Lears outfitit was a long curtaincalico gown and a
white horsehair wig and whiskers and then he took his theater paint and
painted Jims face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead dull
solid blue like a man thats been drownded nine days  Blamed if he
warnt the horriblest looking outrage I ever see  Then the duke took and
wrote out a sign on a shingle so

Sick Arabbut harmless when not out of his head

And he nailed that shingle to a lath and stood the lath up four or five
foot in front of the wigwam  Jim was satisfied  He said it was a sight
better than lying tied a couple of years every day and trembling all
over every time there was a sound  The duke told him to make himself
free and easy and if anybody ever come meddling around he must hop out
of the wigwam and carry on a little and fetch a howl or two like a wild
beast and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone  Which
was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldnt
wait for him to howl  Why he didnt only look like he was dead he
looked considerable more than that

These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again because there was so
much money in it but they judged it wouldnt be safe because maybe the
news might a worked along down by this time  They couldnt hit no
project that suited exactly so at last the duke said he reckoned hed
lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he couldnt put up
something on the Arkansaw village and the king he allowed he would drop
over to tother village without any plan but just trust in Providence to
lead him the profitable waymeaning the devil I reckon  We had all
bought store clothes where we stopped last and now the king put hisn
on and he told me to put mine on  I done it of course  The kings
duds was all black and he did look real swell and starchy  I never
knowed how clothes could change a body before  Why before he looked
like the orneriest old rip that ever was but now when hed take off his
new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and
good and pious that youd say he had walked right out of the ark and
maybe was old Leviticus himself  Jim cleaned up the canoe and I got my
paddle ready  There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up
under the point about three mile above the townbeen there a couple
of hours taking on freight  Says the king

Seein how Im dressed I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St
Louis or Cincinnati or some other big place  Go for the steamboat
Huckleberry well come down to the village on her

I didnt have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride  I
fetched the shore a half a mile above the village and then went scooting
along the bluff bank in the easy water  Pretty soon we come to a nice
innocentlooking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat
off of his face for it was powerful warm weather and he had a couple of
big carpetbags by him

Run her nose in shore says the king  I done it  Wher you bound
for young man

For the steamboat going to Orleans

Git aboard says the king  Hold on a minute my servant ll hep you
with them bags  Jump out and hep the gentleman Adolphusmeaning me
I see

I done so and then we all three started on again  The young chap was
mighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather
He asked the king where he was going and the king told him hed come
down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he
was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there  The
young fellow says

When I first see you I says to myself Its Mr Wilks sure and he
come mighty near getting here in time  But then I says again No I
reckon it aint him or else he wouldnt be paddling up the river  You
AINT him are you

No my names BlodgettElexander BlodgettREVEREND Elexander Blodgett
I spose I must say as Im one o the Lords poor servants  But still
Im jist as able to be sorry for Mr Wilks for not arriving in time all
the same if hes missed anything by itwhich I hope he hasnt

Well he dont miss any property by it because hell get that all
right but hes missed seeing his brother Peter diewhich he maynt
mind nobody can tell as to thatbut his brother would a give anything
in this world to see HIM before he died never talked about nothing else
all these three weeks hadnt seen him since they was boys togetherand
hadnt ever seen his brother William at allthats the deef and dumb
oneWilliam aint more than thirty or thirtyfive  Peter and George
were the only ones that come out here George was the married brother
him and his wife both died last year  Harvey and Williams the only ones
thats left now and as I was saying they havent got here in time

Did anybody send em word

Oh yes a month or two ago when Peter was first took because Peter
said then that he sorter felt like he warnt going to get well this time
You see he was pretty old and Georges gyirls was too young to be much
company for him except Mary Jane the redheaded one and so he was
kinder lonesome after George and his wife died and didnt seem to care
much to live  He most desperately wanted to see Harveyand William
too for that matterbecause he was one of them kind that cant bear to
make a will  He left a letter behind for Harvey and said hed told in
it where his money was hid and how he wanted the rest of the property
divided up so Georges gyirls would be all rightfor George didnt
leave nothing  And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen
to

Why do you reckon Harvey dont come  Wher does he live

Oh he lives in EnglandSheffieldpreaches therehasnt ever been in
this country  He hasnt had any too much timeand besides he mightnt a
got the letter at all you know

Too bad too bad he couldnt a lived to see his brothers poor soul
You going to Orleans you say

Yes but that aint only a part of it  Im going in a ship next
Wednesday for Ryo Janeero where my uncle lives

Its a pretty long journey  But itll be lovely wisht I was agoing
Is Mary Jane the oldest  How old is the others

Mary Janes nineteen Susans fifteen and Joannas about fourteen
thats the one that gives herself to good works and has a harelip


Poor things to be left alone in the cold world so

Well they could be worse off  Old Peter had friends and they aint
going to let them come to no harm  Theres Hobson the Babtis preacher
and Deacon Lot Hovey and Ben Rucker and Abner Shackleford and Levi
Bell the lawyer and Dr Robinson and their wives and the widow
Bartley andwell theres a lot of them but these are the ones that
Peter was thickest with and used to write about sometimes when he wrote
home so Harvey ll know where to look for friends when he gets here

Well the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied
that young fellow  Blamed if he didnt inquire about everybody and
everything in that blessed town and all about the Wilkses and about
Peters businesswhich was a tanner and about Georgeswhich was a
carpenter and about Harveyswhich was a dissentering minister and so
on and so on  Then he says

What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for

Because shes a big Orleans boat and I was afeard she mightnt stop
there  When theyre deep they wont stop for a hail  A Cincinnati boat
will but this is a St Louis one

Was Peter Wilks well off

Oh yes pretty well off  He had houses and land and its reckoned he
left three or four thousand in cash hid up somers

When did you say he died

I didnt say but it was last night

Funeral tomorrow likely

Yes bout the middle of the day

Well its all terrible sad but weve all got to go one time or
another So what we want to do is to be prepared then were all right

Yes sir its the best way  Ma used to always say that

When we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she
got off  The king never said nothing about going aboard so I lost my
ride after all  When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up
another mile to a lonesome place and then he got ashore and says

Now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new
carpetbags  And if hes gone over to tother side go over there and
git him  And tell him to git himself up regardless  Shove along now

I see what HE was up to but I never said nothing of course  When I got
back with the duke we hid the canoe and then they set down on a log and
the king told him everything just like the young fellow had said it
every last word of it  And all the time he was adoing it he tried to
talk like an Englishman and he done it pretty well too for a slouch
I cant imitate him and so I aint agoing to try to but he really done
it pretty good  Then he says

How are you on the deef and dumb Bilgewater

The duke said leave him alone for that said he had played a deef and
dumb person on the histronic boards  So then they waited for a
steamboat

About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along
but they didnt come from high enough up the river but at last there was
a big one and they hailed her  She sent out her yawl and we went
aboard and she was from Cincinnati and when they found we only wanted
to go four or five mile they was booming mad and gave us a cussing and
said they wouldnt land us  But the king was cam  He says

If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and
put off in a yawl a steamboat kin afford to carry em cant it

So they softened down and said it was all right and when we got to the
village they yawled us ashore  About two dozen men flocked down when
they see the yawl acoming and when the king says

Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher Mr Peter Wilks lives they give
a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say What
d I tell you  Then one of them says kind of soft and gentle

Im sorry sir but the best we can do is to tell you where he DID live
yesterday evening

Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash and fell up
against the man and put his chin on his shoulder and cried down his
back and says

Alas alas our poor brothergone and we never got to see him oh
its too too hard

Then he turns around blubbering and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the
duke on his hands and blamed if he didnt drop a carpetbag and bust out
acrying  If they warnt the beatenest lot them two frauds that ever I
struck

Well the men gathered around and sympathized with them and said all
sorts of kind things to them and carried their carpetbags up the hill
for them and let them lean on them and cry and told the king all about
his brothers last moments and the king he told it all over again on his
hands to the duke and both of them took on about that dead tanner like
theyd lost the twelve disciples  Well if ever I struck anything like
it Im a nigger It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race




CHAPTER XXV

THE news was all over town in two minutes and you could see the people
tearing down on the run from every which way some of them putting on
their coats as they come  Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd
and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march  The windows and
dooryards was full and every minute somebody would say over a fence

Is it THEM

And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say

You bet it is

When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed and the
three girls was standing in the door  Mary Jane WAS redheaded but that
dont make no difference she was most awful beautiful and her face and
her eyes was all lit up like glory she was so glad her uncles was come
The king he spread his arms and Mary Jane she jumped for them and the
harelip jumped for the duke and there they HAD it  Everybody most
leastways women cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have
such good times

Then the king he hunched the duke privateI see him do itand then he
looked around and see the coffin over in the corner on two chairs so
then him and the duke with a hand across each others shoulder and
tother hand to their eyes walked slow and solemn over there everybody
dropping back to give them room and all the talk and noise stopping
people saying Sh and all the men taking their hats off and drooping
their heads so you could a heard a pin fall  And when they got there
they bent over and looked in the coffin and took one sight and then
they bust out acrying so you could a heard them to Orleans most and
then they put their arms around each others necks and hung their chins
over each others shoulders and then for three minutes or maybe four I
never see two men leak the way they done  And mind you everybody was
doing the same and the place was that damp I never see anything like it
Then one of them got on one side of the coffin and tother on tother
side and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin and
let on to pray all to themselves  Well when it come to that it worked
the crowd like you never see anything like it and everybody broke down
and went to sobbing right out loudthe poor girls too and every woman
nearly went up to the girls without saying a word and kissed them
solemn on the forehead and then put their hand on their head and
looked up towards the sky with the tears running down and then busted
out and went off sobbing and swabbing and give the next woman a show  I
never see anything so disgusting

Well by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little and works
himself up and slobbers out a speech all full of tears and flapdoodle
about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the
diseased and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of
four thousand mile but its a trial thats sweetened and sanctified to
us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears and so he thanks them out
of his heart and out of his brothers heart because out of their mouths
they cant words being too weak and cold and all that kind of rot and
slush till it was just sickening and then he blubbers out a pious
goodygoody Amen and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust

And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd
struck up the doxolojer and everybody joined in with all their might
and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting
out Music is a good thing and after all that soulbutter and hogwash I
never see it freshen up things so and sound so honest and bully

Then the king begins to work his jaw again and says how him and his
nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family
would take supper here with them this evening and help set up with the
ashes of the diseased and says if his poor brother laying yonder could
speak he knows who he would name for they was names that was very dear
to him and mentioned often in his letters and so he will name the same
to wit as follows vizzRev Mr Hobson and Deacon Lot Hovey and
Mr Ben Rucker and Abner Shackleford and Levi Bell and Dr Robinson
and their wives and the widow Bartley

Rev Hobson and Dr Robinson was down to the end of the town ahunting
togetherthat is I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to tother
world and the preacher was pinting him right  Lawyer Bell was away up
to Louisville on business  But the rest was on hand and so they all
come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him and
then they shook hands with the duke and didnt say nothing but just kept
asmiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he
made all sorts of signs with his hands and said Googoogoogoogoo
all the time like a baby that cant talk

So the king he blattered along and managed to inquire about pretty much
everybody and dog in town by his name and mentioned all sorts of little
things that happened one time or another in the town or to Georges
family or to Peter  And he always let on that Peter wrote him the
things but that was a lie  he got every blessed one of them out of that
young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat

Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind and the
king he read it out loud and cried over it  It give the dwellinghouse
and three thousand dollars gold to the girls and it give the tanyard
which was doing a good business along with some other houses and land
worth about seven thousand and three thousand dollars in gold to
Harvey and William and told where the six thousand cash was hid down
cellar  So these two frauds said theyd go and fetch it up and have
everything square and aboveboard and told me to come with a candle  We
shut the cellar door behind us and when they found the bag they spilt it
out on the floor and it was a lovely sight all them yallerboys  My
the way the kings eyes did shine  He slaps the duke on the shoulder and
says

Oh THIS aint bully nor nothn  Oh no I reckon not  Why Biljy it
beats the Nonesuch DONT it

The duke allowed it did  They pawed the yallerboys and sifted them
through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor and the king
says

It aint no use talkin bein brothers to a rich dead man and
representatives of furrin heirs thats got left is the line for you and
me Bilge  Thish yer comes of trustn to Providence  Its the best way
in the long run  Ive tried em all and ther aint no better way

Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile and took it on
trust but no they must count it  So they counts it and it comes out
four hundred and fifteen dollars short  Says the king

Dern him I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen
dollars

They worried over that awhile and ransacked all around for it  Then the
duke says

Well he was a pretty sick man and likely he made a mistakeI reckon
thats the way of it  The best ways to let it go and keep still about
it  We can spare it

Oh shucks yes we can SPARE it  I dont kyer nothn bout thatits
the COUNT Im thinkin about  We want to be awful square and open and
aboveboard here you know  We want to lug this hyer money up stairs
and count it before everybodythen ther aint nothn suspicious  But
when the dead man says thers six thousn dollars you know we dont
want to

Hold on says the duke  Les make up the deffisit and he begun to
haul out yallerboys out of his pocket

Its a most amazn good idea dukeyou HAVE got a rattlin clever head
on you says the king  Blest if the old Nonesuch aint a heppin us
out agin and HE begun to haul out yallerjackets and stack them up

It most busted them but they made up the six thousand clean and clear

Say says the duke I got another idea  Les go up stairs and count
this money and then take and GIVE IT TO THE GIRLS

Good land duke lemme hug you  Its the most dazzling idea at ever a
man struck  You have certnly got the most astonishin head I ever see
Oh this is the boss dodge ther aint no mistake bout it  Let em
fetch along their suspicions now if they want tothis ll lay em out

When we got upstairs everybody gethered around the table and the king
he counted it and stacked it up three hundred dollars in a piletwenty
elegant little piles  Everybody looked hungry at it and licked their
chops  Then they raked it into the bag again and I see the king begin
to swell himself up for another speech  He says

Friends all my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them
thats left behind in the vale of sorrers  He has done generous by these
yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered and thats left
fatherless and motherless  Yes and we that knowed him knows that he
would a done MORE generous by em if he hadnt ben afeard o woundin his
dear William and me  Now WOULDNT he  Ther aint no question bout it
in MY mind  Well then what kind o brothers would it be that d stand
in his way at sech a time  And what kind o uncles would it be that d
robyes ROBsech poor sweet lambs as these at he loved so at sech a
time  If I know Williamand I THINK I dohewell Ill jest ask him
He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his
hands and the duke he looks at him stupid and leatherheaded a while
then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning and jumps for the
king googooing with all his might for joy and hugs him about fifteen
times before he lets up  Then the king says I knowed it I reckon THAT
ll convince anybody the way HE feels about it  Here Mary Jane Susan
Joanner take the moneytake it ALL  Its the gift of him that lays
yonder cold but joyful

Mary Jane she went for him Susan and the harelip went for the duke and
then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet  And everybody
crowded up with the tears in their eyes and most shook the hands off of
them frauds saying all the time

You DEAR good soulshow LOVELYhow COULD you

Well then pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased
again and how good he was and what a loss he was and all that and
before long a big ironjawed man worked himself in there from outside
and stood alistening and looking and not saying anything and nobody
saying anything to him either because the king was talking and they was
all busy listening  The king was sayingin the middle of something hed
started in on

they bein partickler friends o the diseased  Thats why theyre
invited here this evenin but tomorrow we want ALL to comeeverybody
for he respected everybody he liked everybody and so its fitten that
his funeral orgies shd be public

And so he went amooning on and on liking to hear himself talk and
every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again till the duke
he couldnt stand it no more so he writes on a little scrap of paper
OBSEQUIES you old fool and folds it up and goes to googooing and
reaching it over peoples heads to him  The king he reads it and puts it
in his pocket and says

Poor William afflicted as he is his HEARTS aluz right  Asks me to
invite everybody to come to the funeralwants me to make em all
welcome  But he neednt a worriedit was jest what I was at

Then he weaves along again perfectly cam and goes to dropping in his
funeral orgies again every now and then just like he done before  And
when he done it the third time he says

I say orgies not because its the common term because it aint
obsequies bein the common termbut because orgies is the right term
Obsequies aint used in England no more nowits gone out  We say
orgies now in England  Orgies is better because it means the thing
youre after more exact  Its a word thats made up outn the Greek
ORGO outside open abroad and the Hebrew JEESUM to plant cover up
hence inTER  So you see funeral orgies is an open er public funeral

He was the WORST I ever struck  Well the ironjawed man he laughed
right in his face  Everybody was shocked  Everybody says Why
DOCTOR and Abner Shackleford says

Why Robinson haint you heard the news  This is Harvey Wilks

The king he smiled eager and shoved out his flapper and says

Is it my poor brothers dear good friend and physician  I

Keep your hands off of me says the doctor  YOU talk like an
Englishman DONT you  Its the worst imitation I ever heard  YOU Peter
Wilkss brother  Youre a fraud thats what you are

Well how they all took on  They crowded around the doctor and tried to
quiet him down and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey d
showed in forty ways that he WAS Harvey and knowed everybody by name
and the names of the very dogs and begged and BEGGED him not to hurt
Harveys feelings and the poor girls feelings and all that  But it
warnt no use he stormed right along and said any man that pretended to
be an Englishman and couldnt imitate the lingo no better than what he
did was a fraud and a liar  The poor girls was hanging to the king and
crying and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on THEM  He says

I was your fathers friend and Im your friend and I warn you as a
friend and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of
harm and trouble to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing
to do with him the ignorant tramp with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew as
he calls it  He is the thinnest kind of an impostorhas come here with
a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres and you
take them for PROOFS and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish
friends here who ought to know better  Mary Jane Wilks you know me for
your friend and for your unselfish friend too  Now listen to me turn
this pitiful rascal outI BEG you to do it  Will you

Mary Jane straightened herself up and my but she was handsome  She
says

HERE is my answer  She hove up the bag of money and put it in the
kings hands and says Take this six thousand dollars and invest for
me and my sisters any way you want to and dont give us no receipt for
it

Then she put her arm around the king on one side and Susan and the
harelip done the same on the other  Everybody clapped their hands and
stomped on the floor like a perfect storm whilst the king held up his
head and smiled proud  The doctor says

All right I wash MY hands of the matter  But I warn you all that a
time s coming when youre going to feel sick whenever you think of this
day And away he went

All right doctor says the king kinder mocking him well try and
get em to send for you which made them all laugh and they said it was
a prime good hit




CHAPTER XXVI

WELL when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off
for spare rooms and she said she had one spare room which would do for
Uncle William and shed give her own room to Uncle Harvey which was a
little bigger and she would turn into the room with her sisters and
sleep on a cot and up garret was a little cubby with a pallet in it
The king said the cubby would do for his valleymeaning me

So Mary Jane took us up and she showed them their rooms which was plain
but nice  She said shed have her frocks and a lot of other traps took
out of her room if they was in Uncle Harveys way but he said they
warnt  The frocks was hung along the wall and before them was a
curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor  There was an old
hair trunk in one corner and a guitarbox in another and all sorts of
little knickknacks and jimcracks around like girls brisken up a room
with  The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for
these fixings and so dont disturb them  The dukes room was pretty
small but plenty good enough and so was my cubby

That night they had a big supper and all them men and women was there
and I stood behind the king and the dukes chairs and waited on them and
the niggers waited on the rest  Mary Jane she set at the head of the
table with Susan alongside of her and said how bad the biscuits was
and how mean the preserves was and how ornery and tough the fried
chickens wasand all that kind of rot the way women always do for to
force out compliments and the people all knowed everything was tiptop
and said sosaid How DO you get biscuits to brown so nice and Where
for the lands sake DID you get these amazn pickles and all that kind
of humbug talkytalk just the way people always does at a supper you
know

And when it was all done me and the harelip had supper in the kitchen
off of the leavings whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up
the things  The harelip she got to pumping me about England and blest
if I didnt think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes  She says

Did you ever see the king

Who  William Fourth  Well I bet I havehe goes to our church  I
knowed he was dead years ago but I never let on  So when I says he goes
to our church she says

Whatregular

Yesregular  His pews right over opposite ournon tother side the
pulpit

I thought he lived in London

Well he does  Where WOULD he live

But I thought YOU lived in Sheffield

I see I was up a stump  I had to let on to get choked with a chicken
bone so as to get time to think how to get down again  Then I says

I mean he goes to our church regular when hes in Sheffield  Thats
only in the summer time when he comes there to take the sea baths

Why how you talkSheffield aint on the sea

Well who said it was

Why you did

I DIDNT nuther

You did

I didnt

You did

I never said nothing of the kind

Well what DID you say then

Said he come to take the sea BATHSthats what I said

Well then hows he going to take the sea baths if it aint on the
sea

Looky here I says did you ever see any Congresswater

Yes

Well did you have to go to Congress to get it

Why no

Well neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea
bath

How does he get it then

Gets it the way people down here gets Congresswaterin barrels  There
in the palace at Sheffield theyve got furnaces and he wants his water
hot  They cant bile that amount of water away off there at the sea
They havent got no conveniences for it

Oh I see now  You might a said that in the first place and saved
time

When she said that I see I was out of the woods again and so I was
comfortable and glad  Next she says

Do you go to church too

Yesregular

Where do you set

Why in our pew

WHOSE pew

Why OURNyour Uncle Harveys

Hisn  What does HE want with a pew

Wants it to set in  What did you RECKON he wanted with it

Why I thought hed be in the pulpit

Rot him I forgot he was a preacher  I see I was up a stump again so I
played another chicken bone and got another think  Then I says

Blame it do you suppose there aint but one preacher to a church

Why what do they want with more

Whatto preach before a king  I never did see such a girl as you
They dont have no less than seventeen

Seventeen  My land  Why I wouldnt set out such a string as that not
if I NEVER got to glory  It must take em a week

Shucks they dont ALL of em preach the same dayonly ONE of em

Well then what does the rest of em do

Oh nothing much  Loll around pass the plateand one thing or
another  But mainly they dont do nothing

Well then what are they FOR

Why theyre for STYLE  Dont you know nothing

Well I dont WANT to know no such foolishness as that  How is servants
treated in England  Do they treat em better n we treat our niggers

NO  A servant aint nobody there  They treat them worse than dogs

Dont they give em holidays the way we do Christmas and New Years
week and Fourth of July

Oh just listen  A body could tell YOU haint ever been to England by
that  Why Harelwhy Joanna they never see a holiday from years end
to years end never go to the circus nor theater nor nigger shows nor
nowheres

Nor church

Nor church

But YOU always went to church

Well I was gone up again  I forgot I was the old mans servant  But
next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was
different from a common servant and HAD to go to church whether he wanted
to or not and set with the family on account of its being the law  But
I didnt do it pretty good and when I got done I see she warnt
satisfied  She says

Honest injun now haint you been telling me a lot of lies

Honest injun says I

None of it at all

None of it at all  Not a lie in it says I

Lay your hand on this book and say it

I see it warnt nothing but a dictionary so I laid my hand on it and
said it  So then she looked a little better satisfied and says

Well then Ill believe some of it but I hope to gracious if Ill
believe the rest

What is it you wont believe Joe says Mary Jane stepping in with
Susan behind her  It aint right nor kind for you to talk so to him
and him a stranger and so far from his people  How would you like to be
treated so

Thats always your way Maimalways sailing in to help somebody before
theyre hurt  I haint done nothing to him  Hes told some stretchers
I reckon and I said I wouldnt swallow it all and thats every bit and
grain I DID say  I reckon he can stand a little thing like that cant
he

I dont care whether twas little or whether twas big hes here in our
house and a stranger and it wasnt good of you to say it  If you was in
his place it would make you feel ashamed and so you oughtnt to say a
thing to another person that will make THEM feel ashamed

Why Maim he said

It dont make no difference what he SAIDthat aint the thing  The
thing is for you to treat him KIND and not be saying things to make him
remember he aint in his own country and amongst his own folks

I says to myself THIS is a girl that Im letting that old reptle rob her
of her money

Then Susan SHE waltzed in and if youll believe me she did give
Harelip hark from the tomb

Says I to myself and this is ANOTHER one that Im letting him rob her of
her money

Then Mary Jane she took another inning and went in sweet and lovely
againwhich was her way but when she got done there warnt hardly
anything left o poor Harelip  So she hollered

All right then says the other girls you just ask his pardon

She done it too and she done it beautiful  She done it so beautiful it
was good to hear and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies so she
could do it again

I says to myself this is ANOTHER one that Im letting him rob her of her
money  And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to
make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends  I felt so ornery
and low down and mean that I says to myself my minds made up Ill hive
that money for them or bust

So then I lit outfor bed I said meaning some time or another  When I
got by myself I went to thinking the thing over  I says to myself shall
I go to that doctor private and blow on these frauds  Nothat wont
do He might tell who told him then the king and the duke would make it
warm for me  Shall I go private and tell Mary Jane  NoI dasnt do
it Her face would give them a hint sure theyve got the money and
theyd slide right out and get away with it  If she was to fetch in help
Id get mixed up in the business before it was done with I judge  No
there aint no good way but one  I got to steal that money somehow and
I got to steal it some way that they wont suspicion that I done it
Theyve got a good thing here and they aint agoing to leave till
theyve played this family and this town for all theyre worth so Ill
find a chance time enough Ill steal it and hide it and by and by when
Im away down the river Ill write a letter and tell Mary Jane where
its hid  But I better hive it tonight if I can because the doctor
maybe hasnt let up as much as he lets on he has he might scare them out
of here yet

So thinks I Ill go and search them rooms  Upstairs the hall was dark
but I found the dukes room and started to paw around it with my hands
but I recollected it wouldnt be much like the king to let anybody else
take care of that money but his own self so then I went to his room and
begun to paw around there  But I see I couldnt do nothing without a
candle and I dasnt light one of course  So I judged Id got to do the
other thinglay for them and eavesdrop  About that time I hears their
footsteps coming and was going to skip under the bed I reached for it
but it wasnt where I thought it would be but I touched the curtain that
hid Mary Janes frocks so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in
amongst the gowns and stood there perfectly still

They come in and shut the door and the first thing the duke done was to
get down and look under the bed  Then I was glad I hadnt found the bed
when I wanted it  And yet you know its kind of natural to hide under
the bed when you are up to anything private  They sets down then and
the king says

Well what is it  And cut it middlin short because its better for us
to be down there awhoopin up the mournin than up here givin em a
chance to talk us over

Well this is it Capet  I aint easy I aint comfortable  That
doctor lays on my mind  I wanted to know your plans  Ive got a notion
and I think its a sound one

What is it duke

That we better glide out of this before three in the morning and clip
it down the river with what weve got  Specially seeing we got it so
easyGIVEN back to us flung at our heads as you may say when of
course we allowed to have to steal it back  Im for knocking off and
lighting out

That made me feel pretty bad  About an hour or two ago it would a been a
little different but now it made me feel bad and disappointed The king
rips out and says

What  And not sell out the rest o the property  March off like a
passel of fools and leave eight or nine thousn dollars worth o
property layin around jest sufferin to be scooped inand all good
salable stuff too

The duke he grumbled said the bag of gold was enough and he didnt want
to go no deeperdidnt want to rob a lot of orphans of EVERYTHING they
had

Why how you talk says the king  We shant rob em of nothing at
all but jest this money  The people that BUYS the property is the
suffrers because as soon s its found out at we didnt own itwhich
wont be long after weve slidthe sale wont be valid and it ll all
go back to the estate  These yer orphans ll git their house back agin
and thats enough for THEM theyre young and spry and kn easy earn a
livin  THEY aint agoin to suffer  Why jest thinktheres thousns
and thousns that aint nigh so well off  Bless you THEY aint got
nothn to complain of

Well the king he talked him blind so at last he give in and said all
right but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay and that
doctor hanging over them  But the king says

Cuss the doctor  What do we kyer for HIM  Haint we got all the fools
in town on our side  And aint that a big enough majority in any town

So they got ready to go down stairs again  The duke says

I dont think we put that money in a good place

That cheered me up  Id begun to think I warnt going to get a hint of
no kind to help me  The king says

Why

Because Mary Jane ll be in mourning from this out and first you know
the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up
and put em away and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not
borrow some of it

Your heads level agin duke says the king and he comes afumbling
under the curtain two or three foot from where I was  I stuck tight to
the wall and kept mighty still though quivery and I wondered what them
fellows would say to me if they catched me and I tried to think what Id
better do if they did catch me  But the king he got the bag before I
could think more than about a half a thought and he never suspicioned I
was around  They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick
that was under the featherbed and crammed it in a foot or two amongst
the straw and said it was all right now because a nigger only makes up
the featherbed and dont turn over the straw tick only about twice a
year and so it warnt in no danger of getting stole now

But I knowed better  I had it out of there before they was halfway down
stairs  I groped along up to my cubby and hid it there till I could get
a chance to do better  I judged I better hide it outside of the house
somewheres because if they missed it they would give the house a good
ransacking  I knowed that very well  Then I turned in with my clothes
all on but I couldnt a gone to sleep if Id a wanted to I was in such
a sweat to get through with the business  By and by I heard the king and
the duke come up so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the
top of my ladder and waited to see if anything was going to happen  But
nothing did

So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones hadnt
begun yet and then I slipped down the ladder




CHAPTER XXVII

I CREPT to their doors and listened they was snoring  So I tiptoed
along and got down stairs all right  There warnt a sound anywheres  I
peeped through a crack of the diningroom door and see the men that was
watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs  The door was open
into the parlor where the corpse was laying and there was a candle in
both rooms I passed along and the parlor door was open but I see there
warnt nobody in there but the remainders of Peter so I shoved on by
but the front door was locked and the key wasnt there  Just then I
heard somebody coming down the stairs back behind me  I run in the
parlor and took a swift look around and the only place I see to hide the
bag was in the coffin  The lid was shoved along about a foot showing
the dead mans face down in there with a wet cloth over it and his
shroud on  I tucked the moneybag in under the lid just down beyond
where his hands was crossed which made me creep they was so cold and
then I run back across the room and in behind the door

The person coming was Mary Jane  She went to the coffin very soft and
kneeled down and looked in then she put up her handkerchief and I see
she begun to cry though I couldnt hear her and her back was to me  I
slid out and as I passed the diningroom I thought Id make sure them
watchers hadnt seen me so I looked through the crack and everything
was all right  They hadnt stirred

I slipped up to bed feeling ruther blue on accounts of the thing
playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much
resk about it  Says I if it could stay where it is all right because
when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to
Mary Jane and she could dig him up again and get it but that aint the
thing thats going to happen the thing thats going to happen is the
money ll be found when they come to screw on the lid  Then the king ll
get it again and it ll be a long day before he gives anybody another
chance to smouch it from him Of course I WANTED to slide down and get it
out of there but I dasnt try it  Every minute it was getting earlier
now and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir and I
might get catchedcatched with six thousand dollars in my hands that
nobody hadnt hired me to take care of  I dont wish to be mixed up in
no such business as that I says to myself

When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up and the
watchers was gone  There warnt nobody around but the family and the
widow Bartley and our tribe  I watched their faces to see if anything
had been happening but I couldnt tell

Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man and they
set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs and then
set all our chairs in rows and borrowed more from the neighbors till the
hall and the parlor and the diningroom was full  I see the coffin lid
was the way it was before but I dasnt go to look in under it with
folks around

Then the people begun to flock in and the beats and the girls took seats
in the front row at the head of the coffin and for a half an hour the
people filed around slow in single rank and looked down at the dead
mans face a minute and some dropped in a tear and it was all very
still and solemn only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to
their eyes and keeping their heads bent and sobbing a little  There
warnt no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and
blowing nosesbecause people always blows them more at a funeral than
they do at other places except church

When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black
gloves with his softy soothering ways putting on the last touches and
getting people and things all shipshape and comfortable and making no
more sound than a cat  He never spoke he moved people around he
squeezed in late ones he opened up passageways and done it with nods
and signs with his hands  Then he took his place over against the wall
He was the softest glidingest stealthiest man I ever see and there
warnt no more smile to him than there is to a ham

They had borrowed a melodeuma sick one and when everything was ready a
young woman set down and worked it and it was pretty skreeky and
colicky and everybody joined in and sung and Peter was the only one
that had a good thing according to my notion  Then the Reverend Hobson
opened up slow and solemn and begun to talk and straight off the most
outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard it was only
one dog but he made a most powerful racket and he kept it up right
along the parson he had to stand there over the coffin and waityou
couldnt hear yourself think  It was right down awkward and nobody
didnt seem to know what to do  But pretty soon they see that
longlegged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say
Dont you worryjust depend on me  Then he stooped down and begun to
glide along the wall just his shoulders showing over the peoples heads
So he glided along and the powwow and racket getting more and more
outrageous all the time and at last when he had gone around two sides
of the room he disappears down cellar  Then in about two seconds we
heard a whack and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or
two and then everything was dead still and the parson begun his solemn
talk where he left off  In a minute or two here comes this undertakers
back and shoulders gliding along the wall again and so he glided and
glided around three sides of the room and then rose up and shaded his
mouth with his hands and stretched his neck out towards the preacher
over the peoples heads and says in a kind of a coarse whisper HE HAD
A RAT  Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his
place  You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people because
naturally they wanted to know  A little thing like that dont cost
nothing and its just the little things that makes a man to be looked up
to and liked  There warnt no more popular man in town than what that
undertaker was

Well the funeral sermon was very good but pison long and tiresome and
then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage and at
last the job was through and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the
coffin with his screwdriver  I was in a sweat then and watched him
pretty keen But he never meddled at all just slid the lid along as soft
as mush and screwed it down tight and fast  So there I was  I didnt
know whether the money was in there or not  So says I spose somebody
has hogged that bag on the slynow how do I know whether to write to
Mary Jane or not Spose she dug him up and didnt find nothing what
would she think of me Blame it I says I might get hunted up and
jailed Id better lay low and keep dark and not write at all the
things awful mixed now trying to better it Ive worsened it a hundred
times and I wish to goodness Id just let it alone dad fetch the whole
business

They buried him and we come back home and I went to watching faces
againI couldnt help it and I couldnt rest easy  But nothing come
of it the faces didnt tell me nothing

The king he visited around in the evening and sweetened everybody up
and made himself ever so friendly and he give out the idea that his
congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him so he must
hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home  He was
very sorry he was so pushed and so was everybody they wished he could
stay longer but they said they could see it couldnt be done  And he
said of course him and William would take the girls home with them and
that pleased everybody too because then the girls would be well fixed
and amongst their own relations and it pleased the girls tootickled
them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world and told
him to sell out as quick as he wanted to they would be ready  Them poor
things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting
fooled and lied to so but I didnt see no safe way for me to chip in and
change the general tune

Well blamed if the king didnt bill the house and the niggers and all
the property for auction straight offsale two days after the funeral
but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to

So the next day after the funeral along about noontime the girls joy
got the first jolt  A couple of nigger traders come along and the king
sold them the niggers reasonable for threeday drafts as they called it
and away they went the two sons up the river to Memphis and their
mother down the river to Orleans  I thought them poor girls and them
niggers would break their hearts for grief they cried around each other
and took on so it most made me down sick to see it  The girls said they
hadnt ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the
town  I cant ever get it out of my memory the sight of them poor
miserable girls and niggers hanging around each others necks and crying
and I reckon I couldnt a stood it all but would a had to bust out and
tell on our gang if I hadnt knowed the sale warnt no account and the
niggers would be back home in a week or two

The thing made a big stir in the town too and a good many come out
flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the
children that way  It injured the frauds some but the old fool he
bulled right along spite of all the duke could say or do and I tell you
the duke was powerful uneasy

Next day was auction day  About broad day in the morning the king and
the duke come up in the garret and woke me up and I see by their look
that there was trouble  The king says

Was you in my room night before last

No your majestywhich was the way I always called him when nobody but
our gang warnt around

Was you in there yisterday er last night

No your majesty

Honor bright nowno lies

Honor bright your majesty Im telling you the truth  I haint been
anear your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it
to you

The duke says

Have you seen anybody else go in there

No your grace not as I remember I believe

Stop and think

I studied awhile and see my chance then I says

Well I see the niggers go in there several times

Both of them gave a little jump and looked like they hadnt ever
expected it and then like they HAD  Then the duke says

What all of them

Noleastways not all at oncethat is I dont think I ever see them
all come OUT at once but just one time

Hello  When was that

It was the day we had the funeral  In the morning  It warnt early
because I overslept  I was just starting down the ladder and I see
them

Well go on GO on  What did they do  Howd they act

They didnt do nothing  And they didnt act anyway much as fur as I
see They tiptoed away so I seen easy enough that theyd shoved in
there to do up your majestys room or something sposing you was up
and found you WARNT up and so they was hoping to slide out of the way
of trouble without waking you up if they hadnt already waked you up

Great guns THIS is a go says the king and both of them looked pretty
sick and tolerable silly  They stood there athinking and scratching
their heads a minute and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy
chuckle and says

It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand  They let on to
be SORRY they was going out of this region  And I believed they WAS
sorry and so did you and so did everybody  Dont ever tell ME any more
that a nigger aint got any histrionic talent  Why the way they played
that thing it would fool ANYBODY  In my opinion theres a fortune in
em  If I had capital and a theater I wouldnt want a better layout
than thatand here weve gone and sold em for a song  Yes and aint
privileged to sing the song yet  Say where IS that songthat draft

In the bank for to be collected  Where WOULD it be

Well THATS all right then thank goodness

Says I kind of timidlike

Is something gone wrong

The king whirls on me and rips out

None o your business  You keep your head shet and mind yr own
affairsif you got any  Long as youre in this town dont you forgit
THATyou hear  Then he says to the duke We got to jest swaller it
and say nothn  mums the word for US

As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again and
says

Quick sales AND small profits  Its a good businessyes

The king snarls around on him and says

I was trying to do for the best in sellin em out so quick  If the
profits has turned out to be none lackin considable and none to carry
is it my fault any moren its yourn

Well THEYD be in this house yet and we WOULDNT if I could a got my
advice listened to

The king sassed back as much as was safe for him and then swapped around
and lit into ME again  He give me down the banks for not coming and
TELLING him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that waysaid
any fool would a KNOWED something was up  And then waltzed in and cussed
HIMSELF awhile and said it all come of him not laying late and taking
his natural rest that morning and hed be blamed if hed ever do it
again  So they went off ajawing and I felt dreadful glad Id worked it
all off on to the niggers and yet hadnt done the niggers no harm by it




CHAPTER XXVIII

BY and by it was gettingup time  So I come down the ladder and started
for downstairs but as I come to the girls room the door was open and
I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk which was open and shed
been packing things in itgetting ready to go to England  But she had
stopped now with a folded gown in her lap and had her face in her hands
crying  I felt awful bad to see it of course anybody would  I went in
there and says

Miss Mary Jane you cant abear to see people in trouble and I cant
most always  Tell me about it

So she done it  And it was the niggersI just expected it  She said
the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her she didnt
know HOW she was ever going to be happy there knowing the mother and the
children warnt ever going to see each other no moreand then busted out
bitterer than ever and flung up her hands and says

Oh dear dear to think they aint EVER going to see each other any
more

But they WILLand inside of two weeksand I KNOW it says I

Laws it was out before I could think  And before I could budge she
throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it AGAIN say it AGAIN
say it AGAIN

I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much and was in a close place
I asked her to let me think a minute and she set there very impatient
and excited and handsome but looking kind of happy and easedup like a
person thats had a tooth pulled out  So I went to studying it out  I
says to myself I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is
in a tight place is taking considerable many resks though I aint had no
experience and cant say for certain but it looks so to me anyway and
yet heres a case where Im blest if it dont look to me like the truth
is better and actuly SAFER than a lie  I must lay it by in my mind and
think it over some time or other its so kind of strange and unregular
I never see nothing like it  Well I says to myself at last Im agoing
to chance it Ill up and tell the truth this time though it does seem
most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see
where youll go to Then I says

Miss Mary Jane is there any place out of town a little ways where you
could go and stay three or four days

Yes Mr Lothrops  Why

Never mind why yet  If Ill tell you how I know the niggers will see
each other again inside of two weekshere in this houseand PROVE how I
know itwill you go to Mr Lothrops and stay four days

Four days she says Ill stay a year

All right I says I dont want nothing more out of YOU than just your
wordI druther have it than another mans kisstheBible  She smiled
and reddened up very sweet and I says If you dont mind it Ill shut
the doorand bolt it

Then I come back and set down again and says

Dont you holler  Just set still and take it like a man  I got to tell
the truth and you want to brace up Miss Mary because its a bad kind
and going to be hard to take but there aint no help for it  These
uncles of yourn aint no uncles at all theyre a couple of frauds
regular deadbeats  There now were over the worst of it you can stand
the rest middling easy

It jolted her up like everything of course but I was over the shoal
water now so I went right along her eyes ablazing higher and higher
all the time and told her every blame thing from where we first struck
that young fool going up to the steamboat clear through to where she
flung herself on to the kings breast at the front door and he kissed her
sixteen or seventeen timesand then up she jumps with her face afire
like sunset and says

The brute  Come dont waste a minutenot a SECONDwell have them
tarred and feathered and flung in the river

Says I

Certnly  But do you mean BEFORE you go to Mr Lothrops or

Oh she says what am I THINKING about she says and set right down
again  Dont mind what I saidplease dontyou WONT now WILL you
Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would
die first  I never thought I was so stirred up she says now go on
and I wont do so any more  You tell me what to do and whatever you say
Ill do it

Well I says its a rough gang them two frauds and Im fixed so I
got to travel with them a while longer whether I want to or notI
druther not tell you why and if you was to blow on them this town would
get me out of their claws and Id be all right but thered be another
person that you dont know about whod be in big trouble  Well we got
to save HIM haint we  Of course  Well then we wont blow on them

Saying them words put a good idea in my head  I see how maybe I could
get me and Jim rid of the frauds get them jailed here and then leave
But I didnt want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard
to answer questions but me so I didnt want the plan to begin working
till pretty late tonight  I says

Miss Mary Jane Ill tell you what well do and you wont have to stay
at Mr Lothrops so long nuther  How fur is it

A little short of four milesright out in the country back here

Well that ll answer  Now you go along out there and lay low till
nine or halfpast tonight and then get them to fetch you home again
tell them youve thought of something  If you get here before eleven put
a candle in this window and if I dont turn up wait TILL eleven and
THEN if I dont turn up it means Im gone and out of the way and safe
Then you come out and spread the news around and get these beats
jailed

Good she says Ill do it

And if it just happens so that I dont get away but get took up along
with them you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand and
you must stand by me all you can

Stand by you indeed I will  They shant touch a hair of your head
she says and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said
it too

If I get away I shant be here I says to prove these rapscallions
aint your uncles and I couldnt do it if I WAS here  I could swear
they was beats and bummers thats all though thats worth something
Well theres others can do that better than what I can and theyre
people that aint going to be doubted as quick as Id be  Ill tell you
how to find them  Gimme a pencil and a piece of paper  ThereRoyal
Nonesuch Bricksville  Put it away and dont lose it  When the court
wants to find out something about these two let them send up to
Bricksville and say theyve got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch
and ask for some witnesseswhy youll have that entire town down here
before you can hardly wink Miss Mary  And theyll come abiling too

I judged we had got everything fixed about right now  So I says

Just let the auction go right along and dont worry  Nobody dont have
to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on
accounts of the short notice and they aint going out of this till they
get that money and the way weve fixed it the sale aint going to count
and they aint going to get no money  Its just like the way it was with
the niggersit warnt no sale and the niggers will be back before
long  Why they cant collect the money for the NIGGERS yettheyre in
the worst kind of a fix Miss Mary

Well she says Ill run down to breakfast now and then Ill start
straight for Mr Lothrops

Deed THAT aint the ticket Miss Mary Jane I says by no manner of
means go BEFORE breakfast

Why

What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for Miss Mary

Well I never thoughtand come to think I dont know  What was it

Why its because you aint one of these leatherface people  I dont
want no better book than what your face is  A body can set down and read
it off like coarse print  Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles
when they come to kiss you goodmorning and never

There there dont  Yes Ill go before breakfastIll be glad to
And leave my sisters with them

Yes never mind about them  Theyve got to stand it yet a while  They
might suspicion something if all of you was to go  I dont want you to
see them nor your sisters nor nobody in this town if a neighbor was to
ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something  No
you go right along Miss Mary Jane and Ill fix it with all of them
Ill tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say youve went
away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change or to see a
friend and youll be back tonight or early in the morning

Gone to see a friend is all right but I wont have my love given to
them

Well then it shant be  It was well enough to tell HER sono harm
in it  It was only a little thing to do and no trouble and its the
little things that smooths peoples roads the most down here below it
would make Mary Jane comfortable and it wouldnt cost nothing  Then I
says  Theres one more thingthat bag of money

Well theyve got that and it makes me feel pretty silly to think HOW
they got it

No youre out there  They haint got it

Why whos got it

I wish I knowed but I dont  I HAD it because I stole it from them
and I stole it to give to you and I know where I hid it but Im afraid
it aint there no more  Im awful sorry Miss Mary Jane Im just as
sorry as I can be but I done the best I could I did honest  I come
nigh getting caught and I had to shove it into the first place I come
to and runand it warnt a good place

Oh stop blaming yourselfits too bad to do it and I wont allow it
you couldnt help it it wasnt your fault  Where did you hide it

I didnt want to set her to thinking about her troubles again and I
couldnt seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that
corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach  So
for a minute I didnt say nothing then I says

Id ruther not TELL you where I put it Miss Mary Jane if you dont
mind letting me off but Ill write it for you on a piece of paper and
you can read it along the road to Mr Lothrops if you want to  Do you
reckon that ll do

Oh yes

So I wrote  I put it in the coffin  It was in there when you was
crying there away in the night  I was behind the door and I was mighty
sorry for you Miss Mary Jane

It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by
herself in the night and them devils laying there right under her own
roof shaming her and robbing her and when I folded it up and give it to
her I see the water come into her eyes too and she shook me by the
hand hard and says

GOODbye  Im going to do everything just as youve told me and if I
dont ever see you again I shant ever forget you and Ill think of
you a many and a many a time and Ill PRAY for you tooand she was
gone

Pray for me  I reckoned if she knowed me shed take a job that was more
nearer her size  But I bet she done it just the sameshe was just that
kind  She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notionthere
warnt no backdown to her I judge  You may say what you want to but
in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see in my
opinion she was just full of sand  It sounds like flattery but it aint
no flattery  And when it comes to beautyand goodness tooshe lays
over them all  I haint ever seen her since that time that I see her go
out of that door no I haint ever seen her since but I reckon Ive
thought of her a many and a many a million times and of her saying she
would pray for me and if ever Id a thought it would do any good for me
to pray for HER blamed if I wouldnt a done it or bust

Well Mary Jane she lit out the back way I reckon because nobody see
her go  When I struck Susan and the harelip I says

Whats the name of them people over on tother side of the river that
you all goes to see sometimes

They says

Theres several but its the Proctors mainly

Thats the name I says I most forgot it  Well Miss Mary Jane she
told me to tell you shes gone over there in a dreadful hurryone of
thems sick

Which one

I dont know leastways I kinder forget but I thinks its

Sakes alive I hope it aint HANNER

Im sorry to say it I says but Hanners the very one

My goodness and she so well only last week  Is she took bad

It aint no name for it  They set up with her all night Miss Mary Jane
said and they dont think shell last many hours

Only think of that now  Whats the matter with her

I couldnt think of anything reasonable right off that way so I says

Mumps

Mumps your granny  They dont set up with people thats got the mumps

They dont dont they  You better bet they do with THESE mumps  These
mumps is different  Its a new kind Miss Mary Jane said

Hows it a new kind

Because its mixed up with other things

What other things

Well measles and whoopingcough and erysiplas and consumption and
yaller janders and brainfever and I dont know what all

My land  And they call it the MUMPS

Thats what Miss Mary Jane said

Well what in the nation do they call it the MUMPS for

Why because it IS the mumps  Thats what it starts with

Well ther aint no sense in it  A body might stump his toe and take
pison and fall down the well and break his neck and bust his brains
out and somebody come along and ask what killed him and some numskull
up and say Why he stumped his TOE  Would ther be any sense in that
NO  And ther aint no sense in THIS nuther  Is it ketching

Is it KETCHING  Why how you talk  Is a HARROW catchingin the dark
If you dont hitch on to one tooth youre bound to on another aint
you And you cant get away with that tooth without fetching the whole
harrow along can you  Well these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow
as you may sayand it aint no slouch of a harrow nuther you come to
get it hitched on good

Well its awful I think says the harelip  Ill go to Uncle Harvey
and

Oh yes I says I WOULD  Of COURSE I would  I wouldnt lose no
time

Well why wouldnt you

Just look at it a minute and maybe you can see  Haint your uncles
obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can  And do you
reckon theyd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that
journey by yourselves  YOU know theyll wait for you  So fur so good
Your uncle Harveys a preacher aint he  Very well then is a PREACHER
going to deceive a steamboat clerk is he going to deceive a SHIP CLERK
so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard  Now YOU know he
aint  What WILL he do then  Why hell say Its a great pity but
my church matters has got to get along the best way they can for my
niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribusunum mumps and so its
my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to
show on her if shes got it  But never mind if you think its best to
tell your uncle Harvey

Shucks and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good
times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Janes
got it or not  Why you talk like a muggins

Well anyway maybe youd better tell some of the neighbors

Listen at that now  You do beat all for natural stupidness  Cant you
SEE that THEYD go and tell  Ther aint no way but just to not tell
anybody at ALL

Well maybe youre rightyes I judge you ARE right

But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey shes gone out a while
anyway so he wont be uneasy about her

Yes Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that  She says Tell them to
give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss and say Ive run over
the river to see MrMrwhat IS the name of that rich family your
uncle Peter used to think so much ofI mean the one that

Why you must mean the Apthorps aint it

Of course bother them kind of names a body cant ever seem to remember
them half the time somehow  Yes she said say she has run over for to
ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house
because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than anybody
else and shes going to stick to them till they say theyll come and
then if she aint too tired shes coming home and if she is shell be
home in the morning anyway  She said dont say nothing about the
Proctors but only about the Apthorpswhich ll be perfectly true
because she is going there to speak about their buying the house I know
it because she told me so herself

All right they said and cleared out to lay for their uncles and give
them the love and the kisses and tell them the message

Everything was all right now  The girls wouldnt say nothing because
they wanted to go to England and the king and the duke would ruther Mary
Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor
Robinson  I felt very good I judged I had done it pretty neatI
reckoned Tom Sawyer couldnt a done it no neater himself  Of course he
would a throwed more style into it but I cant do that very handy not
being brung up to it

Well they held the auction in the public square along towards the end
of the afternoon and it strung along and strung along and the old man
he was on hand and looking his level pisonest up there longside of the
auctioneer and chipping in a little Scripture now and then or a little
goodygoody saying of some kind and the duke he was around googooing
for sympathy all he knowed how and just spreading himself generly

But by and by the thing dragged through and everything was sold
everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard  So theyd got
to work that offI never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting
to swallow EVERYTHING  Well whilst they was at it a steamboat landed
and in about two minutes up comes a crowd awhooping and yelling and
laughing and carrying on and singing out

HERES your opposition line heres your two sets o heirs to old Peter
Wilksand you pays your money and you takes your choice




CHAPTER XXIX


THEY was fetching a very nicelooking old gentleman along and a
nicelooking younger one with his right arm in a sling  And my souls
how the people yelled and laughed and kept it up  But I didnt see no
joke about it and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to
see any  I reckoned theyd turn pale  But no nary a pale did THEY
turn The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up but just went
a googooing around happy and satisfied like a jug thats googling out
buttermilk and as for the king he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful
on them newcomers like it give him the stomachache in his very heart to
think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world  Oh he done
it admirable  Lots of the principal people gethered around the king to
let him see they was on his side  That old gentleman that had just come
looked all puzzled to death  Pretty soon he begun to speak and I see
straight off he pronounced LIKE an Englishmannot the kings way though
the kings WAS pretty good for an imitation  I cant give the old gents
words nor I cant imitate him but he turned around to the crowd and
says about like this

This is a surprise to me which I wasnt looking for and Ill
acknowledge candid and frank I aint very well fixed to meet it and
answer it for my brother and me has had misfortunes hes broke his arm
and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night
by a mistake  I am Peter Wilks brother Harvey and this is his brother
William which cant hear nor speakand cant even make signs to amount
to much nowt hes only got one hand to work them with  We are who we
say we are and in a day or two when I get the baggage I can prove it
But up till then I wont say nothing more but go to the hotel and wait

So him and the new dummy started off and the king he laughs and
blethers out

Broke his armVERY likely AINT itand very convenient too for a
fraud thats got to make signs and aint learnt how  Lost their
baggage Thats MIGHTY goodand mighty ingeniousunder the
CIRCUMSTANCES

So he laughed again and so did everybody else except three or four or
maybe half a dozen  One of these was that doctor another one was a
sharplooking gentleman with a carpetbag of the oldfashioned kind made
out of carpetstuff that had just come off of the steamboat and was
talking to him in a low voice and glancing towards the king now and then
and nodding their headsit was Levi Bell the lawyer that was gone up to
Louisville and another one was a big rough husky that come along and
listened to all the old gentleman said and was listening to the king
now And when the king got done this husky up and says

Say looky here if you are Harvey Wilks whend you come to this town

The day before the funeral friend says the king

But what time o day

In the eveninbout an hour er two before sundown

HOWD you come

I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati

Well then howd you come to be up at the Pint in the MORNINin a
canoe

I warnt up at the Pint in the mornin

Its a lie

Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an
old man and a preacher

Preacher be hanged hes a fraud and a liar  He was up at the Pint that
mornin  I live up there dont I  Well I was up there and he was up
there  I see him there  He come in a canoe along with Tim Collins and
a boy

The doctor he up and says

Would you know the boy again if you was to see him Hines

I reckon I would but I dont know  Why yonder he is now  I know him
perfectly easy

It was me he pointed at  The doctor says

Neighbors I dont know whether the new couple is frauds or not but if
THESE two aint frauds I am an idiot thats all  I think its our duty
to see that they dont get away from here till weve looked into this
thing Come along Hines come along the rest of you  Well take these
fellows to the tavern and affront them with tother couple and I reckon
well find out SOMETHING before we get through

It was nuts for the crowd though maybe not for the kings friends so we
all started  It was about sundown  The doctor he led me along by the
hand and was plenty kind enough but he never let go my hand

We all got in a big room in the hotel and lit up some candles and
fetched in the new couple  First the doctor says

I dont wish to be too hard on these two men but I think theyre
frauds and they may have complices that we dont know nothing about  If
they have wont the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks
left  It aint unlikely  If these men aint frauds they wont object
to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove theyre
all rightaint that so

Everybody agreed to that  So I judged they had our gang in a pretty
tight place right at the outstart  But the king he only looked
sorrowful and says

Gentlemen I wish the money was there for I aint got no disposition to
throw anything in the way of a fair open outandout investigation o
this misable business but alas the money aint there you kn send and
see if you want to

Where is it then

Well when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it
inside o the straw tick o my bed not wishin to bank it for the few
days wed be here and considerin the bed a safe place we not bein
used to niggers and supposn em honest like servants in England  The
niggers stole it the very next mornin after I had went down stairs and
when I sold em I hadnt missed the money yit so they got clean away
with it  My servant here kn tell you bout it gentlemen

The doctor and several said Shucks and I see nobody didnt altogether
believe him  One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it  I said no
but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away and I never
thought nothing only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my
master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them  That
was all they asked me  Then the doctor whirls on me and says

Are YOU English too

I says yes and him and some others laughed and said Stuff

Well then they sailed in on the general investigation and there we had
it up and down hour in hour out and nobody never said a word about
supper nor ever seemed to think about itand so they kept it up and
kept it up and it WAS the worst mixedup thing you ever see  They made
the king tell his yarn and they made the old gentleman tell hisn and
anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a SEEN that the old
gentleman was spinning truth and tother one lies  And by and by they
had me up to tell what I knowed  The king he give me a lefthanded look
out of the corner of his eye and so I knowed enough to talk on the right
side  I begun to tell about Sheffield and how we lived there and all
about the English Wilkses and so on but I didnt get pretty fur till
the doctor begun to laugh and Levi Bell the lawyer says

Set down my boy I wouldnt strain myself if I was you  I reckon you
aint used to lying it dont seem to come handy what you want is
practice  You do it pretty awkward

I didnt care nothing for the compliment but I was glad to be let off
anyway

The doctor he started to say something and turns and says

If youd been in town at first Levi Bell The king broke in and
reached out his hand and says

Why is this my poor dead brothers old friend that hes wrote so often
about

The lawyer and him shook hands and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased
and they talked right along awhile and then got to one side and talked
low and at last the lawyer speaks up and says

That ll fix it  Ill take the order and send it along with your
brothers and then theyll know its all right

So they got some paper and a pen and the king he set down and twisted
his head to one side and chawed his tongue and scrawled off something
and then they give the pen to the dukeand then for the first time the
duke looked sick  But he took the pen and wrote  So then the lawyer
turns to the new old gentleman and says

You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names

The old gentleman wrote but nobody couldnt read it  The lawyer looked
powerful astonished and says

Well it beats MEand snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket
and examined them and then examined the old mans writing and then THEM
again and then says  These old letters is from Harvey Wilks and
heres THESE two handwritings and anybody can see they didnt write
them the king and the duke looked sold and foolish I tell you to see
how the lawyer had took them in and heres THIS old gentlemans hand
writing and anybody can tell easy enough HE didnt write themfact
is the scratches he makes aint properly WRITING at all  Now heres
some letters from

The new old gentleman says

If you please let me explain  Nobody can read my hand but my brother
thereso he copies for me  Its HIS hand youve got there not mine

WELL says the lawyer this IS a state of things  Ive got some of
Williams letters too so if youll get him to write a line or so we can
com

He CANT write with his left hand says the old gentleman  If he
could use his right hand you would see that he wrote his own letters and
mine too  Look at both pleasetheyre by the same hand

The lawyer done it and says

I believe its soand if it aint so theres a heap stronger
resemblance than Id noticed before anyway  Well well well  I
thought we was right on the track of a solution but its gone to grass
partly  But anyway one thing is provedTHESE two aint either of em
Wilksesand he wagged his head towards the king and the duke

Well what do you think  That muleheaded old fool wouldnt give in THEN
Indeed he wouldnt  Said it warnt no fair test  Said his brother
William was the cussedest joker in the world and hadnt tried to write
HE see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the
pen to paper  And so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right
along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying
HIMSELF but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in and says

Ive thought of something  Is there anybody here that helped to lay out
my brhelped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying

Yes says somebody me and Ab Turner done it  Were both here

Then the old man turns towards the king and says

Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast

Blamed if the king didnt have to brace up mighty quick or hed a
squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under it took him
so sudden and mind you it was a thing that was calculated to make most
ANYBODY sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice
because how was HE going to know what was tattooed on the man  He
whitened a little he couldnt help it and it was mighty still in there
and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him  Says I to
myself NOW hell throw up the spongethere aint no more use  Well
did he  A body cant hardly believe it but he didnt  I reckon he
thought hed keep the thing up till he tired them people out so theyd
thin out and him and the duke could break loose and get away  Anyway
he set there and pretty soon he begun to smile and says

Mf  Its a VERY tough question AINT it  YES sir I kn tell you
whats tattooed on his breast  Its jest a small thin blue arrow
thats what it is and if you dont look clost you cant see it  NOW
what do you sayhey

Well I never see anything like that old blister for clean outandout
cheek

The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard and his
eye lights up like he judged hed got the king THIS time and says

Thereyouve heard what he said  Was there any such mark on Peter
Wilks breast

Both of them spoke up and says

We didnt see no such mark

Good says the old gentleman  Now what you DID see on his breast was
a small dim P and a B which is an initial he dropped when he was
young and a W with dashes between them so  PBWand he marked
them that way on a piece of paper  Come aint that what you saw

Both of them spoke up again and says

No we DIDNT  We never seen any marks at all

Well everybody WAS in a state of mind now and they sings out

The whole BILIN of m s frauds  Les duck em les drown em les
ride em on a rail and everybody was whooping at once and there was a
rattling powwow  But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells and
says

GentlemengentleMEN  Hear me just a wordjust a SINGLE wordif you
PLEASE  Theres one way yetlets go and dig up the corpse and look

That took them

Hooray they all shouted and was starting right off but the lawyer
and the doctor sung out

Hold on hold on  Collar all these four men and the boy and fetch THEM
along too

Well do it they all shouted and if we dont find them marks well
lynch the whole gang

I WAS scared now I tell you  But there warnt no getting away you
know They gripped us all and marched us right along straight for the
graveyard which was a mile and a half down the river and the whole town
at our heels for we made noise enough and it was only nine in the
evening

As we went by our house I wished I hadnt sent Mary Jane out of town
because now if I could tip her the wink shed light out and save me and
blow on our deadbeats

Well we swarmed along down the river road just carrying on like
wildcats and to make it more scary the sky was darking up and the
lightning beginning to wink and flitter and the wind to shiver amongst
the leaves This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever
was in and I was kinder stunned everything was going so different from
what I had allowed for stead of being fixed so I could take my own time
if I wanted to and see all the fun and have Mary Jane at my back to
save me and set me free when the closefit come here was nothing in the
world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoomarks  If they
didnt find them

I couldnt bear to think about it and yet somehow I couldnt think
about nothing else  It got darker and darker and it was a beautiful
time to give the crowd the slip but that big husky had me by the wrist
Hinesand a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip  He dragged
me right along he was so excited and I had to run to keep up

When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it
like an overflow  And when they got to the grave they found they had
about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted but nobody hadnt
thought to fetch a lantern  But they sailed into digging anyway by the
flicker of the lightning and sent a man to the nearest house a half a
mile off to borrow one

So they dug and dug like everything and it got awful dark and the rain
started and the wind swished and swushed along and the lightning come
brisker and brisker and the thunder boomed but them people never took
no notice of it they was so full of this business and one minute you
could see everything and every face in that big crowd and the shovelfuls
of dirt sailing up out of the grave and the next second the dark wiped
it all out and you couldnt see nothing at all

At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid and then
such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was to
scrouge in and get a sight you never see and in the dark that way it
was awful  Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so and I
reckon he clean forgot I was in the world he was so excited and panting

All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare and
somebody sings out

By the living jingo heres the bag of gold on his breast

Hines let out a whoop like everybody else and dropped my wrist and give
a big surge to bust his way in and get a look and the way I lit out and
shinned for the road in the dark there aint nobody can tell

I had the road all to myself and I fairly flewleastways I had it all
to myself except the solid dark and the nowandthen glares and the
buzzing of the rain and the thrashing of the wind and the splitting of
the thunder and sure as you are born I did clip it along

When I struck the town I see there warnt nobody out in the storm so I
never hunted for no back streets but humped it straight through the main
one and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it
No light there the house all darkwhich made me feel sorry and
disappointed I didnt know why  But at last just as I was sailing by
FLASH comes the light in Mary Janes window and my heart swelled up
sudden like to bust and the same second the house and all was behind me
in the dark and wasnt ever going to be before me no more in this world
She WAS the best girl I ever see and had the most sand

The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the
towhead I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow and the first time
the lightning showed me one that wasnt chained I snatched it and shoved
It was a canoe and warnt fastened with nothing but a rope  The towhead
was a rattling big distance off away out there in the middle of the
river but I didnt lose no time and when I struck the raft at last I
was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could
afforded it  But I didnt  As I sprung aboard I sung out

Out with you Jim and set her loose  Glory be to goodness were shut
of them

Jim lit out and was acoming for me with both arms spread he was so
full of joy but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in
my mouth and I went overboard backwards for I forgot he was old King
Lear and a drownded Arab all in one and it most scared the livers and
lights out of me  But Jim fished me out and was going to hug me and
bless me and so on he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the
king and the duke but I says

Not now have it for breakfast have it for breakfast  Cut loose and
let her slide

So in two seconds away we went asliding down the river and it DID seem
so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river and
nobody to bother us  I had to skip around a bit and jump up and crack
my heels a few timesI couldnt help it but about the third crack I
noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well and held my breath and
listened and waited and sure enough when the next flash busted out over
the water here they comeand just alaying to their oars and making
their skiff hum  It was the king and the duke

So I wilted right down on to the planks then and give up and it was all
I could do to keep from crying




CHAPTER XXX

WHEN they got aboard the king went for me and shook me by the collar
and says

Tryin to give us the slip was ye you pup  Tired of our company
hey

I says

No your majesty we warntPLEASE dont your majesty

Quick then and tell us what WAS your idea or Ill shake the insides
out o you

Honest Ill tell you everything just as it happened your majesty  The
man that had aholt of me was very good to me and kept saying he had a
boy about as big as me that died last year and he was sorry to see a boy
in such a dangerous fix and when they was all took by surprise by
finding the gold and made a rush for the coffin he lets go of me and
whispers Heel it now or theyll hang ye sure and I lit out  It
didnt seem no good for ME to stayI couldnt do nothing and I didnt
want to be hung if I could get away  So I never stopped running till I
found the canoe and when I got here I told Jim to hurry or theyd catch
me and hang me yet and said I was afeard you and the duke wasnt alive
now and I was awful sorry and so was Jim and was awful glad when we
see you coming you may ask Jim if I didnt

Jim said it was so and the king told him to shut up and said Oh yes
its MIGHTY likely and shook me up again and said he reckoned hed
drownd me  But the duke says

Leggo the boy you old idiot  Would YOU a done any different  Did you
inquire around for HIM when you got loose  I dont remember it

So the king let go of me and begun to cuss that town and everybody in
it But the duke says

You better a blame sight give YOURSELF a good cussing for youre the
one thats entitled to it most  You haint done a thing from the start
that had any sense in it except coming out so cool and cheeky with that
imaginary bluearrow mark  That WAS brightit was right down bully and
it was the thing that saved us  For if it hadnt been for that theyd a
jailed us till them Englishmens baggage comeand thenthe
penitentiary you bet But that trick took em to the graveyard and the
gold done us a still bigger kindness for if the excited fools hadnt let
go all holts and made that rush to get a look wed a slept in our cravats
tonightcravats warranted to WEAR toolonger than WED need em

They was still a minutethinking then the king says kind of
absentminded like

Mf  And we reckoned the NIGGERS stole it

That made me squirm

Yes says the duke kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic WE did

After about a half a minute the king drawls out

Leastways I did

The duke says the same way

On the contrary I did

The king kind of ruffles up and says

Looky here Bilgewater whatr you referrin to

The duke says pretty brisk

When it comes to that maybe youll let me ask what was YOU referring
to

Shucks says the king very sarcastic but I dont knowmaybe you was
asleep and didnt know what you was about

The duke bristles up now and says

Oh let UP on this cussed nonsense do you take me for a blame fool
Dont you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin

YES sir  I know you DO know because you done it yourself

Its a lieand the duke went for him  The king sings out

Take yr hands offleggo my throatI take it all back

The duke says

Well you just own up first that you DID hide that money there
intending to give me the slip one of these days and come back and dig it
up and have it all to yourself

Wait jest a minute dukeanswer me this one question honest and fair
if you didnt put the money there say it and Ill blieve you and take
back everything I said

You old scoundrel I didnt and you know I didnt  There now

Well then I blieve you  But answer me only jest this one morenow
DONT git mad didnt you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide
it

The duke never said nothing for a little bit then he says

Well I dont care if I DID I didnt DO it anyway  But you not only
had it in mind to do it but you DONE it

I wisht I never die if I done it duke and thats honest  I wont say
I warnt goin to do it because I WAS but youI mean somebodygot in
ahead o me

Its a lie  You done it and you got to SAY you done it or

The king began to gurgle and then he gasps out

NoughI OWN UP

I was very glad to hear him say that it made me feel much more easier
than what I was feeling before  So the duke took his hands off and says

If you ever deny it again Ill drown you  Its WELL for you to set
there and blubber like a babyits fitten for you after the way youve
acted I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything
and I atrusting you all the time like you was my own father  You ought
to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot
of poor niggers and you never say a word for em  It makes me feel
ridiculous to think I was soft enough to BELIEVE that rubbage  Cuss you
I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisityou wanted
to get what money Id got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another
and scoop it ALL

The king says timid and still asnuffling

Why duke it was you that said make up the deffisit it warnt me

Dry up  I dont want to hear no more out of you says the duke  And
NOW you see what you GOT by it  Theyve got all their own money back
and all of OURN but a shekel or two BESIDES  Glong to bed and dont
you deffersit ME no more deffersits long s YOU live

So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort
and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle and so in about a half an
hour they was as thick as thieves again and the tighter they got the
lovinger they got and went off asnoring in each others arms  They
both got powerful mellow but I noticed the king didnt get mellow enough
to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the moneybag again  That
made me feel easy and satisfied  Of course when they got to snoring we
had a long gabble and I told Jim everything




CHAPTER XXXI

WE dasnt stop again at any town for days and days kept right along down
the river  We was down south in the warm weather now and a mighty long
ways from home  We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them
hanging down from the limbs like long gray beards  It was the first I
ever see it growing and it made the woods look solemn and dismal  So
now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger and they begun to work
the villages again

First they done a lecture on temperance but they didnt make enough for
them both to get drunk on  Then in another village they started a
dancingschool but they didnt know no more how to dance than a kangaroo
does so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and
pranced them out of town  Another time they tried to go at yellocution
but they didnt yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a
solid good cussing and made them skip out  They tackled missionarying
and mesmerizing and doctoring and telling fortunes and a little of
everything but they couldnt seem to have no luck  So at last they got
just about dead broke and laid around the raft as she floated along
thinking and thinking and never saying nothing by the half a day at a
time and dreadful blue and desperate

And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in
the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time
Jim and me got uneasy  We didnt like the look of it  We judged they
was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever  We turned it over
and over and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into
somebodys house or store or was going into the counterfeitmoney
business or something So then we was pretty scared and made up an
agreement that we wouldnt have nothing in the world to do with such
actions and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold
shake and clear out and leave them behind Well early one morning we hid
the raft in a good safe place about two mile below a little bit of a
shabby village named Pikesville and the king he went ashore and told us
all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if
anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet House to rob
you MEAN says I to myself and when you get through robbing it youll
come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raftand
youll have to take it out in wondering And he said if he warnt back
by midday the duke and me would know it was all right and we was to come
along

So we stayed where we was  The duke he fretted and sweated around and
was in a mighty sour way  He scolded us for everything and we couldnt
seem to do nothing right he found fault with every little thing
Something was abrewing sure  I was good and glad when midday come and
no king we could have a change anywayand maybe a chance for THE
change on top of it  So me and the duke went up to the village and
hunted around there for the king and by and by we found him in the back
room of a little low doggery very tight and a lot of loafers
bullyragging him for sport and he acussing and athreatening with all
his might and so tight he couldnt walk and couldnt do nothing to
them  The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool and the king begun
to sass back and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook
the reefs out of my hind legs and spun down the river road like a deer
for I see our chance and I made up my mind that it would be a long day
before they ever see me and Jim again  I got down there all out of
breath but loaded up with joy and sung out

Set her loose Jim were all right now

But there warnt no answer and nobody come out of the wigwam  Jim was
gone  I set up a shoutand then anotherand then another one and run
this way and that in the woods whooping and screeching but it warnt no
useold Jim was gone  Then I set down and cried I couldnt help it
But I couldnt set still long  Pretty soon I went out on the road
trying to think what I better do and I run across a boy walking and
asked him if hed seen a strange nigger dressed so and so and he says

Yes

Whereabouts says I

Down to Silas Phelps place two mile below here  Hes a runaway
nigger and theyve got him  Was you looking for him

You bet I aint  I run across him in the woods about an hour or two
ago and he said if I hollered hed cut my livers outand told me to lay
down and stay where I was and I done it  Been there ever since afeard
to come out

Well he says you neednt be afeard no more becuz theyve got him
He run off fm down South somers

Its a good job they got him

Well I RECKON  Theres two hunderd dollars reward on him  Its like
picking up money outn the road

Yes it isand I could a had it if Id been big enough I see him
FIRST Who nailed him

It was an old fellowa strangerand he sold out his chance in him for
forty dollars becuz hes got to go up the river and cant wait  Think
o that now  You bet ID wait if it was seven year

Thats me every time says I  But maybe his chance aint worth no
more than that if hell sell it so cheap  Maybe theres something aint
straight about it

But it IS thoughstraight as a string  I see the handbill myself  It
tells all about him to a dotpaints him like a picture and tells the
plantation hes frum below NewrLEANS  NosirreeBOB they aint no
trouble bout THAT speculation you bet you  Say gimme a chaw tobacker
wont ye

I didnt have none so he left  I went to the raft and set down in the
wigwam to think  But I couldnt come to nothing  I thought till I wore
my head sore but I couldnt see no way out of the trouble  After all
this long journey and after all wed done for them scoundrels here it
was all come to nothing everything all busted up and ruined because
they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that and make him
a slave again all his life and amongst strangers too for forty dirty
dollars

Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a
slave at home where his family was as long as hed GOT to be a slave
and so Id better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss
Watson where he was  But I soon give up that notion for two things
shed be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for
leaving her and so shed sell him straight down the river again and if
she didnt everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger and theyd
make Jim feel it all the time and so hed feel ornery and disgraced
And then think of ME  It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a
nigger to get his freedom and if I was ever to see anybody from that
town again Id be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame  Thats
just the way  a person does a lowdown thing and then he dont want to
take no consequences of it Thinks as long as he can hide it it aint no
disgrace  That was my fix exactly  The more I studied about this the
more my conscience went to grinding me and the more wicked and lowdown
and ornery I got to feeling And at last when it hit me all of a sudden
that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and
letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up
there in heaven whilst I was stealing a poor old womans nigger that
hadnt ever done me no harm and now was showing me theres One thats
always on the lookout and aint agoing to allow no such miserable
doings to go only just so fur and no further I most dropped in my tracks
I was so scared  Well I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up
somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked and so I warnt so
much to blame but something inside of me kept saying There was the
Sundayschool you could a gone to it and if youd a done it theyd a
learnt you there that people that acts as Id been acting about that
nigger goes to everlasting fire

It made me shiver  And I about made up my mind to pray and see if I
couldnt try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better  So I
kneeled down  But the words wouldnt come  Why wouldnt they  It
warnt no use to try and hide it from Him  Nor from ME neither  I
knowed very well why they wouldnt come  It was because my heart warnt
right it was because I warnt square it was because I was playing
double  I was letting ON to give up sin but away inside of me I was
holding on to the biggest one of all  I was trying to make my mouth SAY
I would do the right thing and the clean thing and go and write to that
niggers owner and tell where he was but deep down in me I knowed it was
a lie and He knowed it  You cant pray a lieI found that out

So I was full of trouble full as I could be and didnt know what to do
At last I had an idea and I says Ill go and write the letterand then
see if I can pray  Why it was astonishing the way I felt as light as a
feather right straight off and my troubles all gone  So I got a piece
of paper and a pencil all glad and excited and set down and wrote

Miss Watson your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below
Pikesville and Mr Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the
reward if you send

HUCK FINN

I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever
felt so in my life and I knowed I could pray now  But I didnt do it
straight off but laid the paper down and set there thinkingthinking
how good it was all this happened so and how near I come to being lost
and going to hell  And went on thinking  And got to thinking over our
trip down the river and I see Jim before me all the time  in the day
and in the nighttime sometimes moonlight sometimes storms and we
afloating along talking and singing and laughing  But somehow I
couldnt seem to strike no places to harden me against him but only the
other kind  Id see him standing my watch on top of hisn stead of
calling me so I could go on sleeping and see him how glad he was when I
come back out of the fog and when I come to him again in the swamp up
there where the feud was and suchlike times and would always call me
honey and pet me and do everything he could think of for me and how
good he always was and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling
the men we had smallpox aboard and he was so grateful and said I was
the best friend old Jim ever had in the world and the ONLY one hes got
now and then I happened to look around and see that paper

It was a close place  I took it up and held it in my hand  I was
atrembling because Id got to decide forever betwixt two things and
I knowed it  I studied a minute sort of holding my breath and then
says to myself

All right then Ill GO to helland tore it up

It was awful thoughts and awful words but they was said  And I let them
stay said and never thought no more about reforming  I shoved the whole
thing out of my head and said I would take up wickedness again which
was in my line being brung up to it and the other warnt  And for a
starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again and if I
could think up anything worse I would do that too because as long as I
was in and in for good I might as well go the whole hog

Then I set to thinking over how to get at it and turned over some
considerable many ways in my mind and at last fixed up a plan that
suited me  So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down
the river a piece and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my
raft and went for it and hid it there and then turned in  I slept the
night through and got up before it was light and had my breakfast and
put on my store clothes and tied up some others and one thing or another
in a bundle and took the canoe and cleared for shore  I landed below
where I judged was Phelpss place and hid my bundle in the woods and
then filled up the canoe with water and loaded rocks into her and sunk
her where I could find her again when I wanted her about a quarter of a
mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank

Then I struck up the road and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it
Phelpss Sawmill and when I come to the farmhouses two or three
hundred yards further along I kept my eyes peeled but didnt see nobody
around though it was good daylight now  But I didnt mind because I
didnt want to see nobody just yetI only wanted to get the lay of the
land According to my plan I was going to turn up there from the
village not from below  So I just took a look and shoved along
straight for town Well the very first man I see when I got there was
the duke  He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuchthreenight
performancelike that other time  They had the cheek them frauds  I
was right on him before I could shirk  He looked astonished and says

HelLO  Whered YOU come from  Then he says kind of glad and eager
Wheres the raftgot her in a good place

I says

Why thats just what I was going to ask your grace

Then he didnt look so joyful and says

What was your idea for asking ME he says

Well I says when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to
myself we cant get him home for hours till hes soberer so I went
aloafing around town to put in the time and wait  A man up and offered
me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a
sheep and so I went along but when we was dragging him to the boat and
the man left me aholt of the rope and went behind him to shove him
along he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run and we after
him  We didnt have no dog and so we had to chase him all over the
country till we tired him out  We never got him till dark then we
fetched him over and I started down for the raft  When I got there and
see it was gone I says to myself Theyve got into trouble and had to
leave and theyve took my nigger which is the only nigger Ive got in
the world and now Im in a strange country and aint got no property no
more nor nothing and no way to make my living so I set down and
cried  I slept in the woods all night  But what DID become of the raft
thenand Jimpoor Jim

Blamed if I knowthat is whats become of the raft  That old fool had
made a trade and got forty dollars and when we found him in the doggery
the loafers had matched halfdollars with him and got every cent but what
hed spent for whisky and when I got him home late last night and found
the raft gone we said That little rascal has stole our raft and shook
us and run off down the river

I wouldnt shake my NIGGER would Ithe only nigger I had in the
world and the only property

We never thought of that  Fact is I reckon wed come to consider him
OUR nigger yes we did consider him sogoodness knows we had trouble
enough for him  So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke
there warnt anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake
And Ive pegged along ever since dry as a powderhorn  Wheres that ten
cents Give it here

I had considerable money so I give him ten cents but begged him to
spend it for something to eat and give me some because it was all the
money I had and I hadnt had nothing to eat since yesterday  He never
said nothing  The next minute he whirls on me and says

Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us  Wed skin him if he done
that

How can he blow  Haint he run off

No  That old fool sold him and never divided with me and the moneys
gone

SOLD him  I says and begun to cry why he was MY nigger and that
was my money  Where is heI want my nigger

Well you cant GET your nigger thats allso dry up your blubbering
Looky heredo you think YOUD venture to blow on us  Blamed if I think
Id trust you  Why if you WAS to blow on us

He stopped but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before
I went on awhimpering and says

I dont want to blow on nobody and I aint got no time to blow nohow
I got to turn out and find my nigger

He looked kinder bothered and stood there with his bills fluttering on
his arm thinking and wrinkling up his forehead  At last he says

Ill tell you something  We got to be here three days  If youll
promise you wont blow and wont let the nigger blow Ill tell you
where to find him

So I promised and he says

A farmer by the name of Silas Ph and then he stopped  You see he
started to tell me the truth but when he stopped that way and begun to
study and think again I reckoned he was changing his mind  And so he
was He wouldnt trust me he wanted to make sure of having me out of the
way the whole three days  So pretty soon he says

The man that bought him is named Abram FosterAbram G Fosterand he
lives forty mile back here in the country on the road to Lafayette

All right I says I can walk it in three days  And Ill start this
very afternoon

No you wont youll start NOW and dont you lose any time about it
neither nor do any gabbling by the way  Just keep a tight tongue in
your head and move right along and then you wont get into trouble with
US dye hear

That was the order I wanted and that was the one I played for  I wanted
to be left free to work my plans

So clear out he says and you can tell Mr Foster whatever you want
to Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim IS your niggersome idiots
dont require documentsleastways Ive heard theres such down South
here  And when you tell him the handbill and the rewards bogus maybe
hell believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting
em out  Go long now and tell him anything you want to but mind you
dont work your jaw any BETWEEN here and there

So I left and struck for the back country  I didnt look around but I
kinder felt like he was watching me  But I knowed I could tire him out
at that  I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before I
stopped then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps  I
reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling
around because I wanted to stop Jims mouth till these fellows could get
away  I didnt want no trouble with their kind  Id seen all I wanted
to of them and wanted to get entirely shut of them




CHAPTER XXXII

WHEN I got there it was all still and Sundaylike and hot and sunshiny
the hands was gone to the fields and there was them kind of faint
dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and
like everybodys dead and gone and if a breeze fans along and quivers
the leaves it makes you feel mournful because you feel like its spirits
whisperingspirits thats been dead ever so many yearsand you always
think theyre talking about YOU  As a general thing it makes a body wish
HE was dead too and done with it all

Phelps was one of these little onehorse cotton plantations and they
all look alike  A rail fence round a twoacre yard a stile made out of
logs sawed off and upended in steps like barrels of a different length
to climb over the fence with and for the women to stand on when they are
going to jump on to a horse some sickly grasspatches in the big yard
but mostly it was bare and smooth like an old hat with the nap rubbed
off big double loghouse for the white folkshewed logs with the
chinks stopped up with mud or mortar and these mudstripes been
whitewashed some time or another roundlog kitchen with a big broad
open but roofed passage joining it to the house log smokehouse back of
the kitchen three little log niggercabins in a row tother side the
smokehouse one little hut all by itself away down against the back
fence and some outbuildings down a piece the other side ashhopper and
big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut bench by the kitchen door
with bucket of water and a gourd hound asleep there in the sun more
hounds asleep round about about three shade trees away off in a corner
some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence
outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch then the cotton
fields begins and after the fields the woods

I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ashhopper and
started for the kitchen  When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of
a spinningwheel wailing along up and sinking along down again and then
I knowed for certain I wished I was deadfor that IS the lonesomest
sound in the whole world

I went right along not fixing up any particular plan but just trusting
to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come for
Id noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if
I left it alone

When I got halfway first one hound and then another got up and went for
me and of course I stopped and faced them and kept still  And such
another powwow as they made  In a quarter of a minute I was a kind of a
hub of a wheel as you may sayspokes made out of dogscircle of
fifteen of them packed together around me with their necks and noses
stretched up towards me abarking and howling and more acoming you
could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres

A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rollingpin in her
hand singing out Begone YOU Tige you Spot begone sah and she
fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling
and then the rest followed and the next second half of them come back
wagging their tails around me and making friends with me  There aint
no harm in a hound nohow

And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger
boys without anything on but towlinen shirts and they hung on to their
mothers gown and peeped out from behind her at me bashful the way
they always do  And here comes the white woman running from the house
about fortyfive or fifty year old bareheaded and her spinningstick in
her hand and behind her comes her little white children acting the same
way the little niggers was doing  She was smiling all over so she could
hardly standand says

Its YOU at lastAINT it

I out with a Yesm before I thought

She grabbed me and hugged me tight and then gripped me by both hands and
shook and shook and the tears come in her eyes and run down over and
she couldnt seem to hug and shake enough and kept saying You dont
look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would but law sakes I
dont care for that Im so glad to see you  Dear dear it does seem
like I could eat you up  Children its your cousin Tomtell him
howdy

But they ducked their heads and put their fingers in their mouths and
hid behind her  So she run on

Lize hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right awayor did you get
your breakfast on the boat

I said I had got it on the boat  So then she started for the house
leading me by the hand and the children tagging after  When we got
there she set me down in a splitbottomed chair and set herself down on
a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says

Now I can have a GOOD look at you and lawsame Ive been hungry for
it a many and a many a time all these long years and its come at last
We been expecting you a couple of days and more  What kep youboat
get aground

Yesmshe

Dont say yesmsay Aunt Sally  Whered she get aground

I didnt rightly know what to say because I didnt know whether the boat
would be coming up the river or down  But I go a good deal on instinct
and my instinct said she would be coming upfrom down towards Orleans
That didnt help me much though for I didnt know the names of bars
down that way  I see Id got to invent a bar or forget the name of the
one we got aground onorNow I struck an idea and fetched it out

It warnt the groundingthat didnt keep us back but a little  We
blowed out a cylinderhead

Good gracious anybody hurt

Nom  Killed a nigger

Well its lucky because sometimes people do get hurt  Two years ago
last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old
Lally Rook and she blowed out a cylinderhead and crippled a man  And I
think he died afterwards  He was a Baptist  Your uncle Silas knowed a
family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well  Yes I remember
now he DID die  Mortification set in and they had to amputate him
But it didnt save him  Yes it was mortificationthat was it  He
turned blue all over and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection
They say he was a sight to look at  Your uncles been up to the town
every day to fetch you And hes gone again not moren an hour ago
hell be back any minute now You must a met him on the road didnt
youoldish man with a

No I didnt see nobody Aunt Sally  The boat landed just at daylight
and I left my baggage on the wharfboat and went looking around the town
and out a piece in the country to put in the time and not get here too
soon and so I come down the back way

Whod you give the baggage to

Nobody

Why child it ll be stole

Not where I hid it I reckon it wont I says

Howd you get your breakfast so early on the boat

It was kinder thin ice but I says

The captain see me standing around and told me I better have something
to eat before I went ashore so he took me in the texas to the officers
lunch and give me all I wanted

I was getting so uneasy I couldnt listen good  I had my mind on the
children all the time I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them
a little and find out who I was  But I couldnt get no show Mrs
Phelps kept it up and run on so  Pretty soon she made the cold chills
streak all down my back because she says

But here were arunning on this way and you haint told me a word
about Sis nor any of them  Now Ill rest my works a little and you
start up yourn just tell me EVERYTHINGtell me all about m all every
one of m and how they are and what theyre doing and what they told
you to tell me and every last thing you can think of

Well I see I was up a stumpand up it good  Providence had stood by me
this fur all right but I was hard and tight aground now  I see it
warnt a bit of use to try to go aheadId got to throw up my hand  So
I says to myself heres another place where I got to resk the truth  I
opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the
bed and says

Here he comes  Stick your head down lowerthere thatll do you cant
be seen now  Dont you let on youre here  Ill play a joke on him
Children dont you say a word

I see I was in a fix now  But it warnt no use to worry there warnt
nothing to do but just hold still and try and be ready to stand from
under when the lightning struck

I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in then
the bed hid him  Mrs Phelps she jumps for him and says

Has he come

No says her husband

GoodNESS gracious she says what in the warld can have become of
him

I cant imagine says the old gentleman and I must say it makes me
dreadful uneasy

Uneasy she says Im ready to go distracted  He MUST a come and
youve missed him along the road  I KNOW its sosomething tells me
so

Why Sally I COULDNT miss him along the roadYOU know that

But oh dear dear what WILL Sis say  He must a come  You must a
missed him  He

Oh dont distress me any moren Im already distressed  I dont know
what in the world to make of it  Im at my wits end and I dont mind
acknowledging t Im right down scared  But theres no hope that hes
come for he COULDNT come and me miss him  Sally its terriblejust
terriblesomethings happened to the boat sure

Why Silas  Look yonderup the roadaint that somebody coming

He sprung to the window at the head of the bed and that give Mrs Phelps
the chance she wanted  She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and
give me a pull and out I come and when he turned back from the window
there she stood abeaming and asmiling like a house afire and I
standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside  The old gentleman stared and
says

Why whos that

Who do you reckon t is

I haint no idea  Who IS it

Its TOM SAWYER

By jings I most slumped through the floor  But there warnt no time to
swap knives the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook and kept on
shaking and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and
cry and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid and Mary
and the rest of the tribe

But if they was joyful it warnt nothing to what I was for it was like
being born again I was so glad to find out who I was  Well they froze
to me for two hours and at last when my chin was so tired it couldnt
hardly go any more I had told them more about my familyI mean the
Sawyer familythan ever happened to any six Sawyer families  And I
explained all about how we blowed out a cylinderhead at the mouth of
White River and it took us three days to fix it  Which was all right
and worked firstrate because THEY didnt know but what it would take
three days to fix it  If Id a called it a bolthead it would a done just
as well

Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side and pretty
uncomfortable all up the other  Being Tom Sawyer was easy and
comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a
steamboat coughing along down the river  Then I says to myself spose
Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat  And spose he steps in here any
minute and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep
quiet

Well I couldnt HAVE it that way it wouldnt do at all  I must go up
the road and waylay him  So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to
the town and fetch down my baggage  The old gentleman was for going
along with me but I said no I could drive the horse myself and I
druther he wouldnt take no trouble about me




CHAPTER XXXIII

SO I started for town in the wagon and when I was halfway I see a wagon
coming and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer and I stopped and waited till
he come along  I says Hold on and it stopped alongside and his mouth
opened up like a trunk and stayed so and he swallowed two or three
times like a person thats got a dry throat and then says

I haint ever done you no harm  You know that  So then what you want
to come back and hant ME for

I says

I haint come backI haint been GONE

When he heard my voice it righted him up some but he warnt quite
satisfied yet  He says

Dont you play nothing on me because I wouldnt on you  Honest injun
now you aint a ghost

Honest injun I aint I says

WellIIwell that ought to settle it of course but I cant
somehow seem to understand it no way  Looky here warnt you ever
murdered AT ALL

No  I warnt ever murdered at allI played it on them  You come in
here and feel of me if you dont believe me

So he done it and it satisfied him and he was that glad to see me again
he didnt know what to do  And he wanted to know all about it right off
because it was a grand adventure and mysterious and so it hit him where
he lived  But I said leave it alone till by and by and told his driver
to wait and we drove off a little piece and I told him the kind of a
fix I was in and what did he reckon we better do  He said let him
alone a minute and dont disturb him  So he thought and thought and
pretty soon he says

Its all right Ive got it  Take my trunk in your wagon and let on
its yourn and you turn back and fool along slow so as to get to the
house about the time you ought to and Ill go towards town a piece and
take a fresh start and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you
and you neednt let on to know me at first

I says

All right but wait a minute  Theres one more thinga thing that
NOBODY dont know but me  And that is theres a nigger here that Im
atrying to steal out of slavery and his name is JIMold Miss Watsons
Jim

He says

What  Why Jim is

He stopped and went to studying  I says

I know what youll say  Youll say its dirty lowdown business but
what if it is  Im low down and Im agoing to steal him and I want
you keep mum and not let on  Will you

His eye lit up and he says

Ill HELP you steal him

Well I let go all holts then like I was shot  It was the most
astonishing speech I ever heardand Im bound to say Tom Sawyer fell
considerable in my estimation  Only I couldnt believe it  Tom Sawyer a
NIGGERSTEALER

Oh shucks  I says youre joking

I aint joking either

Well then I says joking or no joking if you hear anything said
about a runaway nigger dont forget to remember that YOU dont know
nothing about him and I dont know nothing about him

Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon and he drove off his way
and I drove mine  But of course I forgot all about driving slow on
accounts of being glad and full of thinking so I got home a heap too
quick for that length of a trip  The old gentleman was at the door and
he says

Why this is wonderful  Whoever would a thought it was in that mare to
do it  I wish wed a timed her  And she haint sweated a hairnot a
hair Its wonderful  Why I wouldnt take a hundred dollars for that
horse nowI wouldnt honest and yet Id a sold her for fifteen
before and thought twas all she was worth

Thats all he said  He was the innocentest best old soul I ever see
But it warnt surprising because he warnt only just a farmer he was a
preacher too and had a little onehorse log church down back of the
plantation which he built it himself at his own expense for a church
and schoolhouse and never charged nothing for his preaching and it was
worth it too  There was plenty other farmerpreachers like that and
done the same way down South

In about half an hour Toms wagon drove up to the front stile and Aunt
Sally she see it through the window because it was only about fifty
yards and says

Why theres somebody come  I wonder who tis  Why I do believe its
a stranger  Jimmy thats one of the children run and tell Lize to
put on another plate for dinner

Everybody made a rush for the front door because of course a stranger
dont come EVERY year and so he lays over the yallerfever for
interest when he does come  Tom was over the stile and starting for the
house the wagon was spinning up the road for the village and we was all
bunched in the front door  Tom had his store clothes on and an
audienceand that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer  In them circumstances
it warnt no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was
suitable  He warnt a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep no
he come cam and important like the ram  When he got afront of us he
lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty like it was the lid of a box
that had butterflies asleep in it and he didnt want to disturb them and
says

Mr Archibald Nichols I presume

No my boy says the old gentleman Im sorry to say t your driver
has deceived you Nicholss place is down a matter of three mile more
Come in come in

Tom he took a look back over his shoulder and says Too latehes out
of sight

Yes hes gone my son and you must come in and eat your dinner with
us and then well hitch up and take you down to Nicholss

Oh I CANT make you so much trouble I couldnt think of it  Ill walk
I dont mind the distance

But we wont LET you walkit wouldnt be Southern hospitality to do it
Come right in

Oh DO says Aunt Sally it aint a bit of trouble to us not a bit in
the world  You must stay  Its a long dusty three mile and we cant
let you walk  And besides Ive already told em to put on another
plate when I see you coming so you mustnt disappoint us  Come right in
and make yourself at home

So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome and let himself be
persuaded and come in and when he was in he said he was a stranger from
Hicksville Ohio and his name was William Thompsonand he made another
bow

Well he run on and on and on making up stuff about Hicksville and
everybody in it he could invent and I getting a little nervious and
wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape and at last
still talking along he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the
mouth and then settled back again in his chair comfortable and was
going on talking but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her
hand and says

You owdacious puppy

He looked kind of hurt and says

Im surprised at you mam

Youre srpWhy what do you reckon I am  Ive a good notion to take
andSay what do you mean by kissing me

He looked kind of humble and says

I didnt mean nothing mam  I didnt mean no harm  IIthought
youd like it

Why you born fool  She took up the spinning stick and it looked like
it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it  What
made you think Id like it

Well I dont know  Only theytheytold me you would

THEY told you I would  Whoever told yous ANOTHER lunatic  I never
heard the beat of it  Whos THEY

Why everybody  They all said so mam

It was all she could do to hold in and her eyes snapped and her fingers
worked like she wanted to scratch him and she says

Whos everybody  Out with their names or therll be an idiot short

He got up and looked distressed and fumbled his hat and says

Im sorry and I warnt expecting it  They told me to  They all told
me to  They all said kiss her and said shed like it  They all said
itevery one of them  But Im sorry mam and I wont do it no more
I wont honest

You wont wont you  Well I shd RECKON you wont

Nom Im honest about it I wont ever do it againtill you ask me

Till I ASK you  Well I never see the beat of it in my born days  I
lay youll be the Methusalemnumskull of creation before ever I ask you
or the likes of you

Well he says it does surprise me so  I cant make it out somehow
They said you would and I thought you would  But He stopped and
looked around slow like he wished he could run across a friendly eye
somewheres and fetched up on the old gentlemans and says Didnt YOU
think shed like me to kiss her sir

Why no IIwell no I blieve I didnt

Then he looks on around the same way to me and says

Tom didnt YOU think Aunt Sally d open out her arms and say Sid
Sawyer

My land she says breaking in and jumping for him you impudent young
rascal to fool a body so and was going to hug him but he fended her
off and says

No not till youve asked me first

So she didnt lose no time but asked him and hugged him and kissed him
over and over again and then turned him over to the old man and he took
what was left  And after they got a little quiet again she says

Why dear me I never see such a surprise  We warnt looking for YOU at
all but only Tom  Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him

Its because it warnt INTENDED for any of us to come but Tom he says
but I begged and begged and at the last minute she let me come too
so coming down the river me and Tom thought it would be a firstrate
surprise for him to come here to the house first and for me to by and by
tag along and drop in and let on to be a stranger  But it was a
mistake Aunt Sally  This aint no healthy place for a stranger to
come

Nonot impudent whelps Sid  You ought to had your jaws boxed I
haint been so put out since I dont know when  But I dont care I
dont mind the termsId be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to
have you here Well to think of that performance  I dont deny it I
was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack

We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the
kitchen and there was things enough on that table for seven families
and all hot too none of your flabby tough meat thats laid in a
cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold
cannibal in the morning  Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing
over it but it was worth it and it didnt cool it a bit neither the
way Ive seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times  There was a
considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon and me and Tom was on
the lookout all the time but it warnt no use they didnt happen to say
nothing about any runaway nigger and we was afraid to try to work up to
it  But at supper at night one of the little boys says

Pa maynt Tom and Sid and me go to the show

No says the old man I reckon there aint going to be any and you
couldnt go if there was because the runaway nigger told Burton and me
all about that scandalous show and Burton said he would tell the people
so I reckon theyve drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this
time

So there it wasbut I couldnt help it  Tom and me was to sleep in the
same room and bed so being tired we bid goodnight and went up to bed
right after supper and clumb out of the window and down the
lightningrod and shoved for the town for I didnt believe anybody was
going to give the king and the duke a hint and so if I didnt hurry up
and give them one theyd get into trouble sure

On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered
and how pap disappeared pretty soon and didnt come back no more and
what a stir there was when Jim run away and I told Tom all about our
Royal Nonesuch rapscallions and as much of the raft voyage as I had
time to and as we struck into the town and up through the middle of
itit was as much as halfafter eight thenhere comes a raging rush of
people with torches and an awful whooping and yelling and banging tin
pans and blowing horns and we jumped to one side to let them go by and
as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a
railthat is I knowed it WAS the king and the duke though they was
all over tar and feathers and didnt look like nothing in the world
that was humanjust looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier
plumes  Well it made me sick to see it and I was sorry for them poor
pitiful rascals it seemed like I couldnt ever feel any hardness
against them any more in the world  It was a dreadful thing to see
Human beings CAN be awful cruel to one another

We see we was too latecouldnt do no good  We asked some stragglers
about it and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent
and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of
his cavortings on the stage then somebody give a signal and the house
rose up and went for them

So we poked along back home and I warnt feeling so brash as I was
before but kind of ornery and humble and to blame somehowthough I
hadnt done nothing  But thats always the way it dont make no
difference whether you do right or wrong a persons conscience aint got
no sense and just goes for him anyway  If I had a yaller dog that
didnt know no more than a persons conscience does I would pison him
It takes up more room than all the rest of a persons insides and yet
aint no good nohow  Tom Sawyer he says the same




CHAPTER XXXIV

WE stopped talking and got to thinking  By and by Tom says

Looky here Huck what fools we are to not think of it before  I bet I
know where Jim is

No  Where

In that hut down by the ashhopper  Why looky here  When we was at
dinner didnt you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles

Yes

What did you think the vittles was for

For a dog

So d I Well it wasnt for a dog

Why

Because part of it was watermelon

So it wasI noticed it  Well it does beat all that I never thought
about a dog not eating watermelon  It shows how a body can see and dont
see at the same time

Well the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in and he locked it
again when he came out  He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up
from tablesame key I bet  Watermelon shows man lock shows prisoner
and it aint likely theres two prisoners on such a little plantation
and where the peoples all so kind and good  Jims the prisoner  All
rightIm glad we found it out detective fashion I wouldnt give
shucks for any other way  Now you work your mind and study out a plan
to steal Jim and I will study out one too and well take the one we
like the best

What a head for just a boy to have  If I had Tom Sawyers head I
wouldnt trade it off to be a duke nor mate of a steamboat nor clown in
a circus nor nothing I can think of  I went to thinking out a plan but
only just to be doing something I knowed very well where the right plan
was going to come from  Pretty soon Tom says

Ready

Yes I says

All rightbring it out

My plan is this I says  We can easy find out if its Jim in there
Then get up my canoe tomorrow night and fetch my raft over from the
island  Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the
old mans britches after he goes to bed and shove off down the river on
the raft with Jim hiding daytimes and running nights the way me and Jim
used to do before  Wouldnt that plan work

WORK  Why certnly it would work like rats afighting  But its too
blame simple there aint nothing TO it  Whats the good of a plan that
aint no more trouble than that  Its as mild as goosemilk  Why Huck
it wouldnt make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory

I never said nothing because I warnt expecting nothing different but I
knowed mighty well that whenever he got HIS plan ready it wouldnt have
none of them objections to it

And it didnt  He told me what it was and I see in a minute it was
worth fifteen of mine for style and would make Jim just as free a man as
mine would and maybe get us all killed besides  So I was satisfied and
said we would waltz in on it  I neednt tell what it was here because I
knowed it wouldnt stay the way it was  I knowed he would be changing
it around every which way as we went along and heaving in new
bullinesses wherever he got a chance  And that is what he done

Well one thing was dead sure and that was that Tom Sawyer was in
earnest and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery
That was the thing that was too many for me  Here was a boy that was
respectable and well brung up and had a character to lose and folks at
home that had characters and he was bright and not leatherheaded and
knowing and not ignorant and not mean but kind and yet here he was
without any more pride or rightness or feeling than to stoop to this
business and make himself a shame and his family a shame before
everybody  I COULDNT understand it no way at all  It was outrageous
and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so and so be his true
friend and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself
And I DID start to tell him but he shut me up and says

Dont you reckon I know what Im about  Dont I generly know what Im
about

Yes

Didnt I SAY I was going to help steal the nigger

Yes

WELL then

Thats all he said and thats all I said  It warnt no use to say any
more because when he said hed do a thing he always done it  But I
couldnt make out how he was willing to go into this thing so I just let
it go and never bothered no more about it  If he was bound to have it
so I couldnt help it

When we got home the house was all dark and still so we went on down to
the hut by the ashhopper for to examine it  We went through the yard so
as to see what the hounds would do  They knowed us and didnt make no
more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in
the night  When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the
two sides and on the side I warnt acquainted withwhich was the north
sidewe found a square windowhole up tolerable high with just one
stout board nailed across it  I says

Heres the ticket  This holes big enough for Jim to get through if we
wrench off the board

Tom says

Its as simple as tittattoe threeinarow and as easy as playing
hooky  I should HOPE we can find a way thats a little more complicated
than THAT Huck Finn

Well then I says how ll it do to saw him out the way I done
before I was murdered that time

Thats more LIKE he says  Its real mysterious and troublesome and
good he says but I bet we can find a way thats twice as long  There
aint no hurry les keep on looking around

Betwixt the hut and the fence on the back side was a leanto that
joined the hut at the eaves and was made out of plank  It was as long
as the hut but narrowonly about six foot wide  The door to it was at
the south end and was padlocked  Tom he went to the soapkettle and
searched around and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with
so he took it and prized out one of the staples  The chain fell down
and we opened the door and went in and shut it and struck a match and
see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadnt no connection with
it and there warnt no floor to the shed nor nothing in it but some old
rusty playedout hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow  The
match went out and so did we and shoved in the staple again and the
door was locked as good as ever Tom was joyful  He says

Now were all right  Well DIG him out  It ll take about a week

Then we started for the house and I went in the back dooryou only have
to pull a buckskin latchstring they dont fasten the doorsbut that
warnt romantical enough for Tom Sawyer no way would do him but he must
climb up the lightningrod  But after he got up half way about three
times and missed fire and fell every time and the last time most busted
his brains out he thought hed got to give it up but after he was
rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck and this time
he made the trip

In the morning we was up at break of day and down to the nigger cabins
to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jimif it WAS
Jim that was being fed  The niggers was just getting through breakfast
and starting for the fields and Jims nigger was piling up a tin pan
with bread and meat and things and whilst the others was leaving the
key come from the house

This nigger had a goodnatured chuckleheaded face and his wool was all
tied up in little bunches with thread  That was to keep witches off  He
said the witches was pestering him awful these nights and making him see
all kinds of strange things and hear all kinds of strange words and
noises and he didnt believe he was ever witched so long before in his
life  He got so worked up and got to running on so about his troubles
he forgot all about what hed been agoing to do  So Tom says

Whats the vittles for  Going to feed the dogs

The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face like when you
heave a brickbat in a mudpuddle and he says

Yes Mars Sid A dog  Curus dog too  Does you want to go en look at
im

Yes

I hunched Tom and whispers

You going right here in the daybreak  THAT warnt the plan

No it warnt but its the plan NOW

So drat him we went along but I didnt like it much  When we got in
we couldnt hardly see anything it was so dark but Jim was there sure
enough and could see us and he sings out

Why HUCK  En good LAN ain dat Misto Tom

I just knowed how it would be I just expected it  I didnt know nothing
to do and if I had I couldnt a done it because that nigger busted in
and says

Why de gracious sakes do he know you genlmen

We could see pretty well now  Tom he looked at the nigger steady and
kind of wondering and says

Does WHO know us

Why disyer runaway nigger

I dont reckon he does but what put that into your head

What PUT it dar  Didn he jis dis minute sing out like he knowed you

Tom says in a puzzledup kind of way

Well thats mighty curious  WHO sung out WHEN did he sing out  WHAT
did he sing out And turns to me perfectly cam and says Did YOU
hear anybody sing out

Of course there warnt nothing to be said but the one thing so I says

No I aint heard nobody say nothing

Then he turns to Jim and looks him over like he never see him before
and says

Did you sing out

No sah says Jim I haint said nothing sah

Not a word

No sah I haint said a word

Did you ever see us before

No sah not as I knows on

So Tom turns to the nigger which was looking wild and distressed and
says kind of severe

What do you reckons the matter with you anyway  What made you think
somebody sung out

Oh its de dadblame witches sah en I wisht I was dead I do  Deys
awluz at it sah en dey do mos kill me dey skyers me so  Please to
dont tell nobody bout it sah er ole Mars Silas hell scole me kase
he say dey AINT no witches  I jis wish to goodness he was heah now
DEN what would he say  I jis bet he couldn fine no way to git aroun
it DIS time  But its awluz jis so people dats SOT stays sot dey
wont look into nothnen fine it out fr deyselves en when YOU fine it
out en tell um bout it dey doan blieve you

Tom give him a dime and said we wouldnt tell nobody and told him to
buy some more thread to tie up his wool with and then looks at Jim and
says

I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger  If I was to catch
a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away I wouldnt give him up
Id hang him  And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the
dime and bite it to see if it was good he whispers to Jim and says

Dont ever let on to know us  And if you hear any digging going on
nights its us were going to set you free

Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it then the nigger
come back and we said wed come again some time if the nigger wanted us
to and he said he would more particular if it was dark because the
witches went for him mostly in the dark and it was good to have folks
around then




CHAPTER XXXV

IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast so we left and struck down
into the woods because Tom said we got to have SOME light to see how to
dig by and a lantern makes too much and might get us into trouble what
we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks thats called foxfire and
just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place  We
fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds and set down to rest and Tom
says kind of dissatisfied

Blame it this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be
And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan  There
aint no watchman to be druggednow there OUGHT to be a watchman  There
aint even a dog to give a sleepingmixture to  And theres Jim chained
by one leg with a tenfoot chain to the leg of his bed  why all you
got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain  And Uncle
Silas he trusts everybody sends the key to the punkinheaded nigger and
dont send nobody to watch the nigger  Jim could a got out of that
windowhole before this only there wouldnt be no use trying to travel
with a tenfoot chain on his leg  Why drat it Huck its the stupidest
arrangement I ever see You got to invent ALL the difficulties  Well we
cant help it we got to do the best we can with the materials weve got
Anyhow theres one thingtheres more honor in getting him out
through a lot of difficulties and dangers where there warnt one of them
furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them and
you had to contrive them all out of your own head  Now look at just that
one thing of the lantern  When you come down to the cold facts we
simply got to LET ON that a lanterns resky  Why we could work with a
torchlight procession if we wanted to I believe  Now whilst I think of
it we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we
get

What do we want of a saw

What do we WANT of it  Haint we got to saw the leg of Jims bed
off so as to get the chain loose

Why you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain
off

Well if that aint just like you Huck Finn  You CAN get up the
infantschooliest ways of going at a thing  Why haint you ever read
any books at allBaron Trenck nor Casanova nor Benvenuto Chelleeny
nor Henri IV nor none of them heroes  Who ever heard of getting a
prisoner loose in such an oldmaidy way as that  No the way all the
best authorities does is to saw the bedleg in two and leave it just so
and swallow the sawdust so it cant be found and put some dirt and
grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal cant see no
sign of its being sawed and thinks the bedleg is perfectly sound
Then the night youre ready fetch the leg a kick down she goes slip
off your chain and there you are  Nothing to do but hitch your rope
ladder to the battlements shin down it break your leg in the moat
because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short you knowand theres
your horses and your trusty vassles and they scoop you up and fling you
across a saddle and away you go to your native Langudoc or Navarre or
wherever it is Its gaudy Huck  I wish there was a moat to this cabin
If we get time the night of the escape well dig one

I says

What do we want of a moat when were going to snake him out from under
the cabin

But he never heard me  He had forgot me and everything else  He had his
chin in his hand thinking  Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head
then sighs again and says

No it wouldnt dothere aint necessity enough for it

For what  I says

Why to saw Jims leg off he says

Good land  I says why there aint NO necessity for it  And what
would you want to saw his leg off for anyway

Well some of the best authorities has done it  They couldnt get the
chain off so they just cut their hand off and shoved  And a leg would
be better still  But we got to let that go  There aint necessity
enough in this case and besides Jims a nigger and wouldnt
understand the reasons for it and how its the custom in Europe so
well let it go  But theres one thinghe can have a rope ladder we
can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough  And we
can send it to him in a pie its mostly done that way  And Ive et
worse pies

Why Tom Sawyer how you talk I says Jim aint got no use for a rope
ladder

He HAS got use for it  How YOU talk you better say you dont know
nothing about it  Hes GOT to have a rope ladder they all do

What in the nation can he DO with it

DO with it  He can hide it in his bed cant he  Thats what they all
do and HES got to too  Huck you dont ever seem to want to do
anything thats regular you want to be starting something fresh all the
time Spose he DONT do nothing with it aint it there in his bed for
a clew after hes gone and dont you reckon theyll want clews  Of
course they will  And you wouldnt leave them any  That would be a
PRETTY howdydo WOULDNT it  I never heard of such a thing

Well I says if its in the regulations and hes got to have it all
right let him have it because I dont wish to go back on no
regulations but theres one thing Tom Sawyerif we go to tearing up
our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder were going to get into trouble
with Aunt Sally just as sure as youre born  Now the way I look at it
a hickrybark ladder dont cost nothing and dont waste nothing and is
just as good to load up a pie with and hide in a straw tick as any rag
ladder you can start and as for Jim he aint had no experience and so
he dont care what kind of a

Oh shucks Huck Finn if I was as ignorant as you Id keep still
thats what ID do  Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a
hickrybark ladder  Why its perfectly ridiculous

Well all right Tom fix it your own way but if youll take my advice
youll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline

He said that would do  And that gave him another idea and he says

Borrow a shirt too

What do we want of a shirt Tom

Want it for Jim to keep a journal on

Journal your grannyJIM cant write

Spose he CANT writehe can make marks on the shirt cant he if we
make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron
barrelhoop

Why Tom we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better
one and quicker too

PRISONERS dont have geese running around the donjonkeep to pull pens
out of you muggins  They ALWAYS make their pens out of the hardest
toughest troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like
that they can get their hands on and it takes them weeks and weeks and
months and months to file it out too because theyve got to do it by
rubbing it on the wall  THEY wouldnt use a goosequill if they had it
It aint regular

Well then whatll we make him the ink out of

Many makes it out of ironrust and tears but thats the common sort and
women the best authorities uses their own blood  Jim can do that and
when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to
let the world know where hes captivated he can write it on the bottom
of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window  The Iron Mask
always done that and its a blame good way too

Jim aint got no tin plates  They feed him in a pan

That aint nothing we can get him some

Cant nobody READ his plates

That aint got anything to DO with it Huck Finn  All HES got to do is
to write on the plate and throw it out  You dont HAVE to be able to
read it Why half the time you cant read anything a prisoner writes on
a tin plate or anywhere else

Well then whats the sense in wasting the plates

Why blame it all it aint the PRISONERS plates

But its SOMEBODYS plates aint it

Well sposn it is  What does the PRISONER care whose

He broke off there because we heard the breakfasthorn blowing  So we
cleared out for the house

Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the
clothesline and I found an old sack and put them in it and we went
down and got the foxfire and put that in too  I called it borrowing
because that was what pap always called it but Tom said it warnt
borrowing it was stealing  He said we was representing prisoners and
prisoners dont care how they get a thing so they get it and nobody
dont blame them for it either  It aint no crime in a prisoner to
steal the thing he needs to get away with Tom said its his right and
so as long as we was representing a prisoner we had a perfect right to
steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves
out of prison with  He said if we warnt prisoners it would be a very
different thing and nobody but a mean ornery person would steal when he
warnt a prisoner  So we allowed we would steal everything there was
that come handy  And yet he made a mighty fuss one day after that
when I stole a watermelon out of the niggerpatch and eat it and he made
me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for
Tom said that what he meant was we could steal anything we NEEDED Well
I says I needed the watermelon  But he said I didnt need it to get out
of prison with theres where the difference was  He said if Id a
wanted it to hide a knife in and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal
with it would a been all right  So I let it go at that though I
couldnt see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set
down and chaw over a lot of goldleaf distinctions like that every time I
see a chance to hog a watermelon

Well as I was saying we waited that morning till everybody was settled
down to business and nobody in sight around the yard then Tom he
carried the sack into the leanto whilst I stood off a piece to keep
watch  By and by he come out and we went and set down on the woodpile
to talk  He says

Everythings all right now except tools and thats easy fixed

Tools  I says

Yes

Tools for what

Why to dig with  We aint agoing to GNAW him out are we

Aint them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a
nigger out with  I says

He turns on me looking pitying enough to make a body cry and says

Huck Finn did you EVER hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels and
all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with  Now
I want to ask youif you got any reasonableness in you at allwhat kind
of a show would THAT give him to be a hero  Why they might as well lend
him the key and done with it  Picks and shovelswhy they wouldnt
furnish em to a king

Well then I says if we dont want the picks and shovels what do we
want

A couple of caseknives

To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with

Yes

Confound it its foolish Tom

It dont make no difference how foolish it is its the RIGHT wayand
its the regular way  And there aint no OTHER way that ever I heard
of and Ive read all the books that gives any information about these
things They always dig out with a caseknifeand not through dirt mind
you generly its through solid rock  And it takes them weeks and weeks
and weeks and for ever and ever  Why look at one of them prisoners in
the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef in the harbor of Marseilles that
dug himself out that way how long was HE at it you reckon

I dont know

Well guess

I dont know  A month and a half

THIRTYSEVEN YEARand he come out in China  THATS the kind  I wish
the bottom of THIS fortress was solid rock

JIM dont know nobody in China

Whats THAT got to do with it  Neither did that other fellow  But
youre always awandering off on a side issue  Why cant you stick to
the main point

All rightI dont care where he comes out so he COMES out and Jim
dont either I reckon  But theres one thing anywayJims too old to
be dug out with a caseknife  He wont last

Yes he will LAST too  You dont reckon its going to take thirtyseven
years to dig out through a DIRT foundation do you

How long will it take Tom

Well we cant resk being as long as we ought to because it maynt take
very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans  Hell
hear Jim aint from there  Then his next move will be to advertise Jim
or something like that  So we cant resk being as long digging him out
as we ought to  By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years but
we cant  Things being so uncertain what I recommend is this  that we
really dig right in as quick as we can and after that we can LET ON
to ourselves that we was at it thirtyseven years  Then we can snatch
him out and rush him away the first time theres an alarm  Yes I reckon
that ll be the best way

Now theres SENSE in that I says  Letting on dont cost nothing
letting on aint no trouble and if its any object I dont mind letting
on we was at it a hundred and fifty year  It wouldnt strain me none
after I got my hand in  So Ill mosey along now and smouch a couple of
caseknives

Smouch three he says we want one to make a saw out of

Tom if it aint unregular and irreligious to sejest it I says
theres an old rusty sawblade around yonder sticking under the
weatherboarding behind the smokehouse

He looked kind of weary and discouragedlike and says

It aint no use to try to learn you nothing Huck  Run along and smouch
the knivesthree of them  So I done it




CHAPTER XXXVI

AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the
lightningrod and shut ourselves up in the leanto and got out our pile
of foxfire and went to work  We cleared everything out of the way
about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log  Tom said he
was right behind Jims bed now and wed dig in under it and when we got
through there couldnt nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole
there because Jims counterpin hung down most to the ground and youd
have to raise it up and look under to see the hole  So we dug and dug
with the caseknives till most midnight and then we was dogtired and
our hands was blistered and yet you couldnt see wed done anything
hardly  At last I says

This aint no thirtyseven year job this is a thirtyeight year job
Tom Sawyer

He never said nothing  But he sighed and pretty soon he stopped
digging and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking
Then he says

It aint no use Huck it aint agoing to work  If we was prisoners it
would because then wed have as many years as we wanted and no hurry
and we wouldnt get but a few minutes to dig every day while they was
changing watches and so our hands wouldnt get blistered and we could
keep it up right along year in and year out and do it right and the
way it ought to be done  But WE cant fool along we got to rush we
aint got no time to spare  If we was to put in another night this way
wed have to knock off for a week to let our hands get wellcouldnt
touch a caseknife with them sooner

Well then what we going to do Tom

Ill tell you  It aint right and it aint moral and I wouldnt like
it to get out but there aint only just the one way  we got to dig him
out with the picks and LET ON its caseknives

NOW youre TALKING  I says your head gets leveler and leveler all
the time Tom Sawyer I says  Picks is the thing moral or no moral
and as for me I dont care shucks for the morality of it nohow  When I
start in to steal a nigger or a watermelon or a Sundayschool book I
aint no ways particular how its done so its done  What I want is my
nigger or what I want is my watermelon or what I want is my
Sundayschool book and if a picks the handiest thing thats the thing
Im agoing to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sundayschool
book out with and I dont give a dead rat what the authorities thinks
about it nuther

Well he says theres excuse for picks and lettingon in a case like
this if it warnt so I wouldnt approve of it nor I wouldnt stand by
and see the rules brokebecause right is right and wrong is wrong and
a body aint got no business doing wrong when he aint ignorant and knows
better  It might answer for YOU to dig Jim out with a pick WITHOUT any
letting on because you dont know no better but it wouldnt for me
because I do know better  Gimme a caseknife

He had his own by him but I handed him mine  He flung it down and
says

Gimme a CASEKNIFE

I didnt know just what to dobut then I thought  I scratched around
amongst the old tools and got a pickaxe and give it to him and he took
it and went to work and never said a word

He was always just that particular  Full of principle

So then I got a shovel and then we picked and shoveled turn about and
made the fur fly  We stuck to it about a half an hour which was as long
as we could stand up but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it
When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his
level best with the lightningrod but he couldnt come it his hands was
so sore  At last he says

It aint no use it cant be done  What you reckon I better do  Cant
you think of no way

Yes I says but I reckon it aint regular  Come up the stairs and
let on its a lightningrod

So he done it

Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house
for to make some pens for Jim out of and six tallow candles and I hung
around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance and stole three tin
plates  Tom says it wasnt enough but I said nobody wouldnt ever see
the plates that Jim throwed out because theyd fall in the dogfennel
and jimpson weeds under the windowholethen we could tote them back and
he could use them over again  So Tom was satisfied  Then he says

Now the thing to study out is how to get the things to Jim

Take them in through the hole I says when we get it done

He only just looked scornful and said something about nobody ever heard
of such an idiotic idea and then he went to studying  By and by he said
he had ciphered out two or three ways but there warnt no need to decide
on any of them yet  Said wed got to post Jim first

That night we went down the lightningrod a little after ten and took
one of the candles along and listened under the windowhole and heard
Jim snoring so we pitched it in and it didnt wake him  Then we
whirled in with the pick and shovel and in about two hours and a half
the job was done  We crept in under Jims bed and into the cabin and
pawed around and found the candle and lit it and stood over Jim awhile
and found him looking hearty and healthy and then we woke him up gentle
and gradual  He was so glad to see us he most cried and called us
honey and all the pet names he could think of and was for having us
hunt up a coldchisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away
and clearing out without losing any time  But Tom he showed him how
unregular it would be and set down and told him all about our plans and
how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm and not
to be the least afraid because we would see he got away SURE  So Jim
he said it was all right and we set there and talked over old times
awhile and then Tom asked a lot of questions and when Jim told him
Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him and Aunt Sally
come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat and both of
them was kind as they could be Tom says

NOW I know how to fix it  Well send you some things by them

I said Dont do nothing of the kind its one of the most jackass ideas
I ever struck but he never paid no attention to me went right on  It
was his way when hed got his plans set

So he told Jim how wed have to smuggle in the ropeladder pie and other
large things by Nat the nigger that fed him and he must be on the
lookout and not be surprised and not let Nat see him open them and we
would put small things in uncles coatpockets and he must steal them
out and we would tie things to aunts apronstrings or put them in her
apronpocket if we got a chance and told him what they would be and
what they was for  And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with
his blood and all that He told him everything  Jim he couldnt see no
sense in the most of it but he allowed we was white folks and knowed
better than him so he was satisfied and said he would do it all just as
Tom said

Jim had plenty corncob pipes and tobacco so we had a right down good
sociable time then we crawled out through the hole and so home to bed
with hands that looked like theyd been chawed  Tom was in high spirits
He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life and the most
intellectural and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep
it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out
for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he
got used to it  He said that in that way it could be strung out to as
much as eighty year and would be the best time on record  And he said
it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it

In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass
candlestick into handy sizes and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in
his pocket  Then we went to the nigger cabins and while I got Nats
notice off Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a
cornpone that was in Jims pan and we went along with Nat to see how it
would work and it just worked noble when Jim bit into it it most mashed
all his teeth out and there warnt ever anything could a worked better
Tom said so himself Jim he never let on but what it was only just a
piece of rock or something like that thats always getting into bread
you know but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his
fork into it in three or four places first

And whilst we was astanding there in the dimmish light here comes a
couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jims bed and they kept on
piling in till there was eleven of them and there warnt hardly room in
there to get your breath  By jings we forgot to fasten that leanto
door  The nigger Nat he only just hollered Witches once and keeled
over on to the floor amongst the dogs and begun to groan like he was
dying  Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jims meat and
the dogs went for it and in two seconds he was out himself and back
again and shut the door and I knowed hed fixed the other door too
Then he went to work on the nigger coaxing him and petting him and
asking him if hed been imagining he saw something again  He raised up
and blinked his eyes around and says

Mars Sid youll say Is a fool but if I didnt blieve I see most a
million dogs er devils er somen I wisht I may die right heah in dese
tracks  I did mos sholy  Mars Sid I FELT umI FELT um sah dey was
all over me  Dad fetch it I jis wisht I could git my hans on one er
dem witches jis wunstony jis wunstits all Id ast  But mosly I
wisht deyd lemme lone I does

Tom says

Well I tell you what I think  What makes them come here just at this
runaway niggers breakfasttime  Its because theyre hungry thats the

CHAPTER XXXVII

THAT was all fixed  So then we went away and went to the rubbagepile in
the back yard where they keep the old boots and rags and pieces of
bottles and woreout tin things and all such truck and scratched
around and found an old tin washpan and stopped up the holes as well as
we could to bake the pie in and took it down cellar and stole it full
of flour and started for breakfast and found a couple of shinglenails
that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and
sorrows on the dungeon walls with and dropped one of them in Aunt
Sallys apronpocket which was hanging on a chair and tother we stuck
in the band of Uncle Silass hat which was on the bureau because we
heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway niggers
house this morning and then went to breakfast and Tom dropped the
pewter spoon in Uncle Silass coatpocket and Aunt Sally wasnt come
yet so we had to wait a little while

And when she come she was hot and red and cross and couldnt hardly wait
for the blessing and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand
and cracking the handiest childs head with her thimble with the other
and says

Ive hunted high and Ive hunted low and it does beat all what HAS
become of your other shirt

My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things and a hard
piece of corncrust started down my throat after it and got met on the
road with a cough and was shot across the table and took one of the
children in the eye and curled him up like a fishingworm and let a cry
out of him the size of a warwhoop and Tom he turned kinder blue around
the gills and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for
about a quarter of a minute or as much as that and I would a sold out
for half price if there was a bidder  But after that we was all right
againit was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold
Uncle Silas he says

Its most uncommon curious I cant understand it  I know perfectly
well I took it OFF because

Because you haint got but one ON  Just LISTEN at the man  I know you
took it off and know it by a better way than your woolgethering memory
too because it was on the closline yesterdayI see it there myself
But its gone thats the long and the short of it and youll just have
to change to a red flannl one till I can get time to make a new one
And it ll be the third Ive made in two years  It just keeps a body on
the jump to keep you in shirts and whatever you do manage to DO with m
all is moren I can make out  A body d think you WOULD learn to take
some sort of care of em at your time of life

I know it Sally and I do try all I can  But it oughtnt to be
altogether my fault because you know I dont see them nor have nothing
to do with them except when theyre on me and I dont believe Ive ever
lost one of them OFF of me

Well it aint YOUR fault if you havent Silas youd a done it if you
could I reckon  And the shirt aint all thats gone nuther  Thers a
spoon gone and THAT aint all  There was ten and now thers only nine
The calf got the shirt I reckon but the calf never took the spoon
THATS certain

Why what else is gone Sally

Thers six CANDLES gonethats what  The rats could a got the candles
and I reckon they did I wonder they dont walk off with the whole place
the way youre always going to stop their holes and dont do it and if
they warnt fools theyd sleep in your hair SilasYOUD never find it
out but you cant lay the SPOON on the rats and that I know

Well Sally Im in fault and I acknowledge it Ive been remiss but I
wont let tomorrow go by without stopping up them holes

Oh I wouldnt hurry next year ll do  Matilda Angelina Araminta
PHELPS

Whack comes the thimble and the child snatches her claws out of the
sugarbowl without fooling around any  Just then the nigger woman steps
on to the passage and says

Missus deys a sheet gone

A SHEET gone  Well for the lands sake

Ill stop up them holes today says Uncle Silas looking sorrowful

Oh DO shet upspose the rats took the SHEET  WHERES it gone
Lize

Clah to goodness I haint no notion Miss Sally  She wuz on de
closline yistiddy but she done gone  she ain dah no mo now

I reckon the world IS coming to an end  I NEVER see the beat of it in
all my born days  A shirt and a sheet and a spoon and six can

Missus comes a young yaller wench deys a brass cannelstick missn

Cler out from here you hussy er Ill take a skillet to ye

Well she was just abiling  I begun to lay for a chance I reckoned I
would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated  She
kept araging right along running her insurrection all by herself and
everybody else mighty meek and quiet and at last Uncle Silas looking
kind of foolish fishes up that spoon out of his pocket  She stopped
with her mouth open and her hands up and as for me I wished I was in
Jeruslem or somewheres But not long because she says

Its JUST as I expected  So you had it in your pocket all the time and
like as not youve got the other things there too  Howd it get there

I reely dont know Sally he says kind of apologizing or you know I
would tell  I was astudying over my text in Acts Seventeen before
breakfast and I reckon I put it in there not noticing meaning to put
my Testament in and it must be so because my Testament aint in but
Ill go and see and if the Testament is where I had it Ill know I
didnt put it in and that will show that I laid the Testament down and
took up the spoon and

Oh for the lands sake  Give a body a rest  Go long now the whole
kit and biling of ye and dont come nigh me again till Ive got back my
peace of mind

Id a heard her if shed a said it to herself let alone speaking it out
and Id a got up and obeyed her if Id a been dead  As we was passing
through the settingroom the old man he took up his hat and the
shinglenail fell out on the floor and he just merely picked it up and
laid it on the mantelshelf and never said nothing and went out  Tom
see him do it and remembered about the spoon and says

Well it aint no use to send things by HIM no more he aint reliable
Then he says  But he done us a good turn with the spoon anyway
without knowing it and so well go and do him one without HIM knowing
itstop up his ratholes

There was a noble good lot of them down cellar and it took us a whole
hour but we done the job tight and good and shipshape  Then we heard
steps on the stairs and blowed out our light and hid and here comes the
old man with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in tother
looking as absentminded as year before last  He went a mooning around
first to one rathole and then another till hed been to them all  Then
he stood about five minutes picking tallowdrip off of his candle and
thinking  Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs saying

Well for the life of me I cant remember when I done it  I could show
her now that I warnt to blame on account of the rats  But never mind
let it go  I reckon it wouldnt do no good

And so he went on amumbling up stairs and then we left  He was a
mighty nice old man  And always is

Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon but he said
wed got to have it so he took a think  When he had ciphered it out he
told me how we was to do then we went and waited around the spoonbasket
till we see Aunt Sally coming and then Tom went to counting the spoons
and laying them out to one side and I slid one of them up my sleeve and
Tom says

Why Aunt Sally there aint but nine spoons YET

She says

Go long to your play and dont bother me  I know better I counted m
myself

Well Ive counted them twice Aunty and I cant make but nine

She looked out of all patience but of course she come to countanybody
would

I declare to gracious ther AINT but nine she says  Why what in
the worldplague TAKE the things Ill count m again

So I slipped back the one I had and when she got done counting she
says

Hang the troublesome rubbage thers TEN now and she looked huffy and
bothered both  But Tom says

Why Aunty I dont think theres ten

You numskull didnt you see me COUNT m

I know but

Well Ill count m AGAIN

So I smouched one and they come out nine same as the other time  Well
she WAS in a tearing wayjust atrembling all over she was so mad  But
she counted and counted till she got that addled shed start to count in
the basket for a spoon sometimes and so three times they come out
right and three times they come out wrong  Then she grabbed up the
basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galleywest
and she said cler out and let her have some peace and if we come
bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner shed skin us  So we
had the odd spoon and dropped it in her apronpocket whilst she was
agiving us our sailing orders and Jim got it all right along with her
shingle nail before noon  We was very well satisfied with this
business and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took because
he said NOW she couldnt ever count them spoons twice alike again to save
her life and wouldnt believe shed counted them right if she DID and
said that after shed about counted her head off for the next three days
he judged shed give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to
ever count them any more

So we put the sheet back on the line that night and stole one out of her
closet and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of
days till she didnt know how many sheets she had any more and she
didnt CARE and warnt agoing to bullyrag the rest of her soul out
about it and wouldnt count them again not to save her life she druther
die first

So we was all right now as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and
the candles by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixedup
counting and as to the candlestick it warnt no consequence it would
blow over by and by

But that pie was a job we had no end of trouble with that pie  We fixed
it up away down in the woods and cooked it there and we got it done at
last and very satisfactory too but not all in one day and we had to
use up three washpans full of flour before we got through and we got
burnt pretty much all over in places and eyes put out with the smoke
because you see we didnt want nothing but a crust and we couldnt
prop it up right and she would always cave in  But of course we thought
of the right way at lastwhich was to cook the ladder too in the
pie  So then we laid in with Jim the second night and tore up the sheet
all in little strings and twisted them together and long before daylight
we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with  We let on it
took nine months to make it

And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods but it wouldnt go into
the pie  Being made of a whole sheet that way there was rope enough
for forty pies if wed a wanted them and plenty left over for soup or
sausage or anything you choose  We could a had a whole dinner

But we didnt need it  All we needed was just enough for the pie
and so we throwed the rest away  We didnt cook none of the pies in the
washpanafraid the solder would melt but Uncle Silas he had a noble
brass warmingpan which he thought considerable of because it belonged
to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from
England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early
ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things
that was valuable not on account of being any account because they
warnt but on account of them being relicts you know and we snaked her
out private and took her down there but she failed on the first pies
because we didnt know how but she come up smiling on the last one  We
took and lined her with dough and set her in the coals and loaded her
up with rag rope and put on a dough roof and shut down the lid and put
hot embers on top and stood off five foot with the long handle cool
and comfortable and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a
satisfaction to look at But the person that et it would want to fetch a
couple of kags of toothpicks along for if that rope ladder wouldnt
cramp him down to business I dont know nothing what Im talking about
and lay him in enough stomachache to last him till next time too

Nat didnt look when we put the witch pie in Jims pan and we put the
three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles and so Jim
got everything all right and as soon as he was by himself he busted into
the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick and scratched
some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the windowhole




CHAPTER XXXVIII

MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job and so was the saw and Jim
allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all  Thats the
one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall  But he had to have
it Tom said hed GOT to there warnt no case of a state prisoner not
scrabbling his inscription to leave behind and his coat of arms

Look at Lady Jane Grey he says look at Gilford Dudley look at old
Northumberland  Why Huck spose it IS considerble troublewhat you
going to dohow you going to get around it  Jims GOT to do his
inscription and coat of arms  They all do

Jim says

Why Mars Tom I haint got no coat o arm I haint got nuffn but dish
yer ole shirt en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat

Oh you dont understand Jim a coat of arms is very different

Well I says Jims right anyway when he says he aint got no coat
of arms because he haint

I reckon I knowed that Tom says but you bet hell have one before he
goes out of thisbecause hes going out RIGHT and there aint going to
be no flaws in his record

So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece Jim
amaking hisn out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon Tom
set to work to think out the coat of arms  By and by he said hed struck
so many good ones he didnt hardly know which to take but there was one
which he reckoned hed decide on  He says

On the scutcheon well have a bend OR in the dexter base a saltire
MURREY in the fess with a dog couchant for common charge and under
his foot a chain embattled for slavery with a chevron VERT in a chief
engrailed and three invected lines on a field AZURE with the nombril
points rampant on a dancette indented crest a runaway nigger SABLE
with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister and a couple of
gules for supporters which is you and me motto MAGGIORE FRETTA MINORE
OTTO  Got it out of a bookmeans the more haste the less speed

Geewhillikins I says but what does the rest of it mean

We aint got no time to bother over that he says we got to dig in
like all gitout

Well anyway I says whats SOME of it  Whats a fess

A fessa fess isYOU dont need to know what a fess is  Ill show him
how to make it when he gets to it

Shucks Tom I says I think you might tell a person  Whats a bar
sinister

Oh I dont know  But hes got to have it  All the nobility does

That was just his way  If it didnt suit him to explain a thing to you
he wouldnt do it  You might pump at him a week it wouldnt make no
difference

Hed got all that coat of arms business fixed so now he started in to
finish up the rest of that part of the work which was to plan out a
mournful inscriptionsaid Jim got to have one like they all done  He
made up a lot and wrote them out on a paper and read them off so

1  Here a captive heart busted 2  Here a poor prisoner forsook by the
world and friends fretted his sorrowful life 3  Here a lonely heart
broke and a worn spirit went to its rest after thirtyseven years of
solitary captivity 4  Here homeless and friendless after thirtyseven
years of bitter captivity perished a noble stranger natural son of
Louis XIV

Toms voice trembled whilst he was reading them and he most broke down
When he got done he couldnt no way make up his mind which one for Jim to
scrabble on to the wall they was all so good but at last he allowed he
would let him scrabble them all on  Jim said it would take him a year to
scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail and he didnt
know how to make letters besides but Tom said he would block them out
for him and then he wouldnt have nothing to do but just follow the
lines  Then pretty soon he says

Come to think the logs aint agoing to do they dont have log walls
in a dungeon  we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock  Well fetch a
rock

Jim said the rock was worse than the logs he said it would take him such
a pison long time to dig them into a rock he wouldnt ever get out  But
Tom said he would let me help him do it  Then he took a look to see how
me and Jim was getting along with the pens  It was most pesky tedious
hard work and slow and didnt give my hands no show to get well of the
sores and we didnt seem to make no headway hardly so Tom says

I know how to fix it  We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and
mournful inscriptions and we can kill two birds with that same rock
Theres a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill and well smouch it and
carve the things on it and file out the pens and the saw on it too

It warnt no slouch of an idea and it warnt no slouch of a grindstone
nuther but we allowed wed tackle it  It warnt quite midnight yet so
we cleared out for the mill leaving Jim at work  We smouched the
grindstone and set out to roll her home but it was a most nation tough
job Sometimes do what we could we couldnt keep her from falling over
and she come mighty near mashing us every time  Tom said she was going
to get one of us sure before we got through  We got her half way and
then we was plumb played out and most drownded with sweat  We see it
warnt no use we got to go and fetch Jim So he raised up his bed and
slid the chain off of the bedleg and wrapt it round and round his neck
and we crawled out through our hole and down there and Jim and me laid
into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing and Tom
superintended  He could outsuperintend any boy I ever see  He knowed
how to do everything

Our hole was pretty big but it warnt big enough to get the grindstone
through but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough  Then Tom
marked out them things on it with the nail and set Jim to work on them
with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the
leanto for a hammer and told him to work till the rest of his candle
quit on him and then he could go to bed and hide the grindstone under
his straw tick and sleep on it  Then we helped him fix his chain back on
the bedleg and was ready for bed ourselves  But Tom thought of
something and says

You got any spiders in here Jim

No sah thanks to goodness I haint Mars Tom

All right well get you some

But bless you honey I doan WANT none  Is afeard un um  I jis s
soon have rattlesnakes aroun

Tom thought a minute or two and says

Its a good idea  And I reckon its been done  It MUST a been done it
stands to reason  Yes its a prime good idea  Where could you keep
it

Keep what Mars Tom

Why a rattlesnake

De goodness gracious alive Mars Tom  Why if dey was a rattlesnake to
come in heah Id take en bust right out thoo dat log wall I would wid
my head

Why Jim you wouldnt be afraid of it after a little  You could tame
it

TAME it

Yeseasy enough  Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting
and they wouldnt THINK of hurting a person that pets them  Any book
will tell you that  You trythats all I ask just try for two or three
days Why you can get him so in a little while that hell love you and
sleep with you and wont stay away from you a minute and will let you
wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth

PLEASE Mars TomDOAN talk so  I cant STAN it  Hed LET me shove
his head in my mouffer a favor haint it  I lay hed wait a powful
long time fo I AST him  En mo en dat I doan WANT him to sleep wid
me

Jim dont act so foolish  A prisoners GOT to have some kind of a dumb
pet and if a rattlesnake haint ever been tried why theres more glory
to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way
you could ever think of to save your life

Why Mars Tom I doan WANT no sich glory  Snake take n bite Jims
chin off den WHAH is de glory  No sah I doan want no sich doins

Blame it cant you TRY  I only WANT you to tryyou neednt keep it up
if it dont work

But de trouble all DONE ef de snake bite me while Is a tryin him
Mars Tom Is willin to tackle mos anything at aint onreasonable but
ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame Is gwyne to
LEAVE dats SHORE

Well then let it go let it go if youre so bullheaded about it  We
can get you some gartersnakes and you can tie some buttons on their
tails and let on theyre rattlesnakes and I reckon that ll have to
do

I kn stan DEM Mars Tom but blame f I couldn get along widout um
I tell you dat  I never knowed bfo t was so much bother and trouble
to be a prisoner

Well it ALWAYS is when its done right  You got any rats around here

No sah I haint seed none

Well well get you some rats

Why Mars Tom I doan WANT no rats  Deys de dadblamedest creturs to
sturb a body en rustle roun over im en bite his feet when hes
tryin to sleep I ever see  No sah gimme gyartersnakes f Is got
to have m but doan gimme no rats I hain got no use fr um skasely

But Jim you GOT to have emthey all do  So dont make no more fuss
about it  Prisoners aint ever without rats  There aint no instance of
it  And they train them and pet them and learn them tricks and they
get to be as sociable as flies  But you got to play music to them  You
got anything to play music on

I ain got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o paper en a juiceharp
but I reckn dey wouldn take no stock in a juiceharp

Yes they would  THEY dont care what kind of music tis  A jewsharps
plenty good enough for a rat  All animals like musicin a prison they
dote on it  Specially painful music and you cant get no other kind
out of a jewsharp  It always interests them they come out to see
whats the matter with you  Yes youre all right youre fixed very
well  You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep and
early in the mornings and play your jewsharp play The Last Link is
Brokenthats the thing that ll scoop a rat quicker n anything else
and when youve played about two minutes youll see all the rats and the
snakes and spiders and things begin to feel worried about you and
come  And theyll just fairly swarm over you and have a noble good
time

Yes DEY will I reckn Mars Tom but what kine er time is JIM havin
Blest if I kin see de pint  But Ill do it ef I got to  I reckn I
better keep de animals satisfied en not have no trouble in de house

Tom waited to think it over and see if there wasnt nothing else and
pretty soon he says

Oh theres one thing I forgot  Could you raise a flower here do you
reckon

I doan know but maybe I could Mars Tom but its tolable dark in heah
en I ain got no use fr no flower nohow en shed be a powful sight o
trouble

Well you try it anyway  Some other prisoners has done it

One er dem big cattaillookin mullenstalks would grow in heah Mars
Tom I reckn but she wouldnt be wuth half de trouble shed coss

Dont you believe it  Well fetch you a little one and you plant it in
the corner over there and raise it  And dont call it mullen call it
Pitchiolathats its right name when its in a prison  And you want to
water it with your tears

Why I got plenty spring water Mars Tom

You dont WANT spring water you want to water it with your tears  Its
the way they always do

Why Mars Tom I lay I kin raise one er dem mullenstalks twyste wid
spring water whiles another mans a STARTN one wid tears

That aint the idea  You GOT to do it with tears

Shell die on my hans Mars Tom she sholy will kase I doan skasely
ever cry

So Tom was stumped  But he studied it over and then said Jim would have
to worry along the best he could with an onion  He promised he would go
to the nigger cabins and drop one private in Jims coffeepot in the
morning Jim said he would jis s soon have tobacker in his coffee
and found so much fault with it and with the work and bother of raising
the mullen and jewsharping the rats and petting and flattering up the
snakes and spiders and things on top of all the other work he had to do
on pens and inscriptions and journals and things which made it more
trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he
ever undertook that Tom most lost all patience with him and said he was
just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in
the world to make a name for himself and yet he didnt know enough to
appreciate them and they was just about wasted on him  So Jim he was
sorry and said he wouldnt behave so no more and then me and Tom shoved
for bed




CHAPTER XXXIX

IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rattrap and
fetched it down and unstopped the best rathole and in about an hour we
had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones and then we took it and put it
in a safe place under Aunt Sallys bed  But while we was gone for
spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found
it there and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out
and they did and Aunt Sally she come in and when we got back she was
astanding on top of the bed raising Cain and the rats was doing what
they could to keep off the dull times for her  So she took and dusted us
both with the hickry and we was as much as two hours catching another
fifteen or sixteen drat that meddlesome cub and they warnt the
likeliest nuther because the first haul was the pick of the flock
I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was

We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders and bugs and frogs and
caterpillars and one thing or another and we like to got a hornets
nest but we didnt  The family was at home  We didnt give it right
up but stayed with them as long as we could because we allowed wed
tire them out or theyd got to tire us out and they done it  Then we
got allycumpain and rubbed on the places and was pretty near all right
again but couldnt set down convenient  And so we went for the snakes
and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and housesnakes and put them in a
bag and put it in our room and by that time it was suppertime and a
rattling good honest days work  and hungryoh no I reckon not  And
there warnt a blessed snake up there when we went backwe didnt half
tie the sack and they worked out somehow and left  But it didnt
matter much because they was still on the premises somewheres  So we
judged we could get some of them again  No there warnt no real
scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell  Youd see
them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then and they
generly landed in your plate or down the back of your neck and most of
the time where you didnt want them  Well they was handsome and
striped and there warnt no harm in a million of them but that never
made no difference to Aunt Sally she despised snakes be the breed what
they might and she couldnt stand them no way you could fix it and
every time one of them flopped down on her it didnt make no difference
what she was doing she would just lay that work down and light out  I
never see such a woman  And you could hear her whoop to Jericho  You
couldnt get her to take aholt of one of them with the tongs  And if
she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a
howl that you would think the house was afire  She disturbed the old man
so that he said he could most wish there hadnt ever been no snakes
created  Why after every last snake had been gone clear out of the
house for as much as a week Aunt Sally warnt over it yet she warnt
near over it when she was setting thinking about something you could
touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right
out of her stockings  It was very curious  But Tom said all women was
just so  He said they was made that way for some reason or other

We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way and she
allowed these lickings warnt nothing to what she would do if we ever
loaded up the place again with them  I didnt mind the lickings because
they didnt amount to nothing but I minded the trouble we had to lay in
another lot  But we got them laid in and all the other things and you
never see a cabin as blithesome as Jims was when theyd all swarm out
for music and go for him  Jim didnt like the spiders and the spiders
didnt like Jim and so theyd lay for him and make it mighty warm for
him  And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone
there warnt no room in bed for him skasely and when there was a body
couldnt sleep it was so lively and it was always lively he said
because THEY never all slept at one time but took turn about so when
the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck and when the rats turned in
the snakes come on watch so he always had one gang under him in his
way and tother gang having a circus over him and if he got up to hunt
a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over
He said if he ever got out this time he wouldnt ever be a prisoner
again not for a salary

Well by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape  The
shirt was sent in early in a pie and every time a rat bit Jim he would
get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh the
pens was made the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the
grindstone the bedleg was sawed in two and we had et up the sawdust
and it give us a most amazing stomachache  We reckoned we was all going
to die but didnt  It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see and
Tom said the same  But as I was saying wed got all the work done now
at last and we was all pretty much fagged out too but mainly Jim  The
old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to
come and get their runaway nigger but hadnt got no answer because
there warnt no such plantation so he allowed he would advertise Jim in
the St Louis and New Orleans papers and when he mentioned the St Louis
ones it give me the cold shivers and I see we hadnt no time to lose
So Tom said now for the nonnamous letters

Whats them  I says

Warnings to the people that something is up  Sometimes its done one
way sometimes another  But theres always somebody spying around that
gives notice to the governor of the castle  When Louis XVI was going to
light out of the Tooleries a servantgirl done it  Its a very good way
and so is the nonnamous letters  Well use them both  And its usual
for the prisoners mother to change clothes with him and she stays in
and he slides out in her clothes  Well do that too

But looky here Tom what do we want to WARN anybody for that
somethings up  Let them find it out for themselvesits their
lookout

Yes I know but you cant depend on them  Its the way theyve acted
from the very startleft us to do EVERYTHING  Theyre so confiding and
mulletheaded they dont take notice of nothing at all  So if we dont
GIVE them notice there wont be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us
and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape ll go off
perfectly flat wont amount to nothingwont be nothing TO it

Well as for me Tom thats the way Id like

Shucks he says and looked disgusted  So I says

But I aint going to make no complaint  Any way that suits you suits
me What you going to do about the servantgirl

Youll be her  You slide in in the middle of the night and hook that
yaller girls frock

Why Tom that ll make trouble next morning because of course she
probbly haint got any but that one

I know but you dont want it but fifteen minutes to carry the
nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door

All right then Ill do it but I could carry it just as handy in my
own togs

You wouldnt look like a servantgirl THEN would you

No but there wont be nobody to see what I look like ANYWAY

That aint got nothing to do with it  The thing for us to do is just to
do our DUTY and not worry about whether anybody SEES us do it or not
Haint you got no principle at all

All right I aint saying nothing Im the servantgirl  Whos Jims
mother

Im his mother  Ill hook a gown from Aunt Sally

Well then youll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves

Not much  Ill stuff Jims clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed
to represent his mother in disguise and Jim ll take the nigger womans
gown off of me and wear it and well all evade together  When a
prisoner of style escapes its called an evasion  Its always called so
when a king escapes frinstance  And the same with a kings son it
dont make no difference whether hes a natural one or an unnatural one

So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter and I smouched the yaller wenchs
frock that night and put it on and shoved it under the front door the
way Tom told me to  It said

Beware  Trouble is brewing  Keep a sharp lookout UNKNOWN FRIEND

Next night we stuck a picture which Tom drawed in blood of a skull and
crossbones on the front door and next night another one of a coffin on
the back door  I never see a family in such a sweat  They couldnt a
been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them
behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air  If a
door banged Aunt Sally she jumped and said ouch if anything fell she
jumped and said ouch if you happened to touch her when she warnt
noticing she done the same she couldnt face noway and be satisfied
because she allowed there was something behind her every timeso she was
always awhirling around sudden and saying ouch and before shed got
twothirds around shed whirl back again and say it again and she was
afraid to go to bed but she dasnt set up  So the thing was working
very well Tom said he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory
He said it showed it was done right

So he said now for the grand bulge  So the very next morning at the
streak of dawn we got another letter ready and was wondering what we
better do with it because we heard them say at supper they was going to
have a nigger on watch at both doors all night  Tom he went down the
lightningrod to spy around and the nigger at the back door was asleep
and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back  This letter said

Dont betray me I wish to be your friend  There is a desprate gang of
cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway
nigger tonight and they have been trying to scare you so as you will
stay in the house and not bother them  I am one of the gang but have
got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again and will
betray the helish design They will sneak down from northards along the
fence at midnight exact with a false key and go in the niggers cabin
to get him I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any
danger but stead of that I will BA like a sheep soon as they get in and
not blow at all then whilst they are getting his chains loose you slip
there and lock them in and can kill them at your leasure  Dont do
anything but just the way I am telling you if you do they will suspicion
something and raise whoopjamboreehoo I do not wish any reward but to
know I have done the right thing UNKNOWN FRIEND




CHAPTER XL

WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast and took my canoe and went
over the river afishing with a lunch and had a good time and took a
look at the raft and found her all right and got home late to supper
and found them in such a sweat and worry they didnt know which end they
was standing on and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done
supper and wouldnt tell us what the trouble was and never let on a
word about the new letter but didnt need to because we knowed as much
about it as anybody did and as soon as we was half up stairs and her
back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good
lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed and got up about
halfpast eleven and Tom put on Aunt Sallys dress that he stole and
was going to start with the lunch but says

Wheres the butter

I laid out a hunk of it I says on a piece of a cornpone

Well you LEFT it laid out thenit aint here

We can get along without it I says

We can get along WITH it too he says just you slide down cellar and
fetch it  And then mosey right down the lightningrod and come along
Ill go and stuff the straw into Jims clothes to represent his mother in
disguise and be ready to BA like a sheep and shove soon as you get
there

So out he went and down cellar went I The hunk of butter big as a
persons fist was where I had left it so I took up the slab of
cornpone with it on and blowed out my light and started up stairs very
stealthy and got up to the main floor all right but here comes Aunt
Sally with a candle and I clapped the truck in my hat and clapped my
hat on my head and the next second she see me and she says

You been down cellar

Yesm

What you been doing down there

Nothn

NOTHN

Nom

Well then what possessed you to go down there this time of night

I dont know m

You dont KNOW  Dont answer me that way Tom I want to know what you
been DOING down there

I haint been doing a single thing Aunt Sally I hope to gracious if I
have

I reckoned shed let me go now and as a generl thing she would but I
spose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat
about every little thing that warnt yardstick straight so she says
very decided

You just march into that settingroom and stay there till I come  You
been up to something you no business to and I lay Ill find out what it
is before IM done with you

So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the settingroom
My but there was a crowd there  Fifteen farmers and every one of them
had a gun  I was most powerful sick and slunk to a chair and set down
They was setting around some of them talking a little in a low voice
and all of them fidgety and uneasy but trying to look like they warnt
but I knowed they was because they was always taking off their hats and
putting them on and scratching their heads and changing their seats
and fumbling with their buttons  I warnt easy myself but I didnt take
my hat off all the same

I did wish Aunt Sally would come and get done with me and lick me if
she wanted to and let me get away and tell Tom how wed overdone this
thing and what a thundering hornetsnest wed got ourselves into so we
could stop fooling around straight off and clear out with Jim before
these rips got out of patience and come for us

At last she come and begun to ask me questions but I COULDNT answer
them straight I didnt know which end of me was up because these men
was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and lay
for them desperadoes and saying it warnt but a few minutes to midnight
and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the
sheepsignal and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions and me
ashaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared
and the place getting hotter and hotter and the butter beginning to melt
and run down my neck and behind my ears and pretty soon when one of
them says IM for going and getting in the cabin FIRST and right NOW
and catching them when they come I most dropped and a streak of butter
come atrickling down my forehead and Aunt Sally she see it and turns
white as a sheet and says

For the lands sake what IS the matter with the child  Hes got the
brainfever as shore as youre born and theyre oozing out

And everybody runs to see and she snatches off my hat and out comes the
bread and what was left of the butter and she grabbed me and hugged me
and says

Oh what a turn you did give me and how glad and grateful I am it aint
no worse for lucks against us and it never rains but it pours and
when I see that truck I thought wed lost you for I knowed by the color
and all it was just like your brains would be ifDear dear whydnt you
TELL me that was what youd been down there for I wouldnt a cared  Now
cler out to bed and dont lemme see no more of you till morning

I was up stairs in a second and down the lightningrod in another one
and shinning through the dark for the leanto  I couldnt hardly get my
words out I was so anxious but I told Tom as quick as I could we must
jump for it now and not a minute to losethe house full of men yonder
with guns

His eyes just blazed and he says

Nois that so  AINT it bully  Why Huck if it was to do over
again I bet I could fetch two hundred  If we could put it off till

Hurry  HURRY  I says  Wheres Jim

Right at your elbow if you reach out your arm you can touch him  Hes
dressed and everythings ready  Now well slide out and give the
sheepsignal

But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door and heard them
begin to fumble with the padlock and heard a man say

I TOLD you wed be too soon they havent comethe door is locked
Here Ill lock some of you into the cabin and you lay for em in the
dark and kill em when they come and the rest scatter around a piece
and listen if you can hear em coming

So in they come but couldnt see us in the dark and most trod on us
whilst we was hustling to get under the bed  But we got under all right
and out through the hole swift but softJim first me next and Tom
last which was according to Toms orders  Now we was in the leanto
and heard trampings close by outside  So we crept to the door and Tom
stopped us there and put his eye to the crack but couldnt make out
nothing it was so dark and whispered and said he would listen for the
steps to get further and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first and
him last  So he set his ear to the crack and listened and listened and
listened and the steps ascraping around out there all the time and at
last he nudged us and we slid out and stooped down not breathing and
not making the least noise and slipped stealthy towards the fence in
Injun file and got to it all right and me and Jim over it but Toms
britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail and then he hear the
steps coming so he had to pull loose which snapped the splinter and
made a noise and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings
out

Whos that  Answer or Ill shoot

But we didnt answer we just unfurled our heels and shoved  Then there
was a rush and a BANG BANG BANG and the bullets fairly whizzed around
us We heard them sing out

Here they are  Theyve broke for the river  After em boys and turn
loose the dogs

So here they come full tilt  We could hear them because they wore boots
and yelled but we didnt wear no boots and didnt yell  We was in the
path to the mill and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into
the bush and let them go by and then dropped in behind them  Theyd had
all the dogs shut up so they wouldnt scare off the robbers but by this
time somebody had let them loose and here they come making powwow
enough for a million but they was our dogs so we stopped in our tracks
till they catched up and when they see it warnt nobody but us and no
excitement to offer them they only just said howdy and tore right ahead
towards the shouting and clattering and then we upsteam again and
whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill and then struck
up through the bush to where my canoe was tied and hopped in and pulled
for dear life towards the middle of the river but didnt make no more
noise than we was obleeged to Then we struck out easy and comfortable
for the island where my raft was and we could hear them yelling and
barking at each other all up and down the bank till we was so far away
the sounds got dim and died out  And when we stepped on to the raft I
says

NOW old Jim youre a free man again and I bet you wont ever be a
slave no more

En a mighty good job it wuz too Huck  It uz planned beautiful en it
uz done beautiful en dey aint NOBODY kin git up a plan dats mo
mixedup en splendid den what dat one wuz

We was all glad as we could be but Tom was the gladdest of all because
he had a bullet in the calf of his leg

When me and Jim heard that we didnt feel so brash as what we did before
It was hurting him considerable and bleeding so we laid him in the
wigwam and tore up one of the dukes shirts for to bandage him but he
says

Gimme the rags I can do it myself  Dont stop now dont fool around
here and the evasion booming along so handsome man the sweeps and set
her loose  Boys we done it elegantdeed we did  I wish WED a had
the handling of Louis XVI there wouldnt a been no Son of Saint Louis
ascend to heaven wrote down in HIS biography no sir wed a whooped
him over the BORDERthats what wed a done with HIMand done it just
as slick as nothing at all too  Man the sweepsman the sweeps

But me and Jim was consultingand thinking  And after wed thought a
minute I says

Say it Jim

So he says

Well den dis is de way it look to me Huck  Ef it wuz HIM dat uz
bein sot free en one er de boys wuz to git shot would he say Go on
en save me nemmine bout a doctor fr to save dis one  Is dat like
Mars Tom Sawyer  Would he say dat  You BET he wouldnt  WELL den is
JIM gywne to say it  No sahI doan budge a step outn dis place dout
a DOCTOR not if its forty year

I knowed he was white inside and I reckoned hed say what he did sayso
it was all right now and I told Tom I was agoing for a doctor  He
raised considerable row about it but me and Jim stuck to it and wouldnt
budge so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself but
we wouldnt let him  Then he give us a piece of his mind but it didnt
do no good

So when he sees me getting the canoe ready he says

Well then if youre bound to go Ill tell you the way to do when you
get to the village  Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and
fast and make him swear to be silent as the grave and put a purse full
of gold in his hand and then take and lead him all around the back
alleys and everywheres in the dark and then fetch him here in the canoe
in a roundabout way amongst the islands and search him and take his
chalk away from him and dont give it back to him till you get him back
to the village or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again
Its the way they all do

So I said I would and left and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see
the doctor coming till he was gone again




CHAPTER XLI

THE doctor was an old man a very nice kindlooking old man when I got
him up  I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting
yesterday afternoon and camped on a piece of a raft we found and about
midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams for it went off and shot
him in the leg and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say
nothing about it nor let anybody know because we wanted to come home
this evening and surprise the folks

Who is your folks he says

The Phelpses down yonder

Oh he says  And after a minute he says

Howd you say he got shot

He had a dream I says and it shot him

Singular dream he says

So he lit up his lantern and got his saddlebags and we started  But
when he sees the canoe he didnt like the look of hersaid she was big
enough for one but didnt look pretty safe for two  I says

Oh you neednt be afeard sir she carried the three of us easy
enough

What three

Why me and Sid andandand THE GUNS thats what I mean

Oh he says

But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her and shook his head and
said he reckoned hed look around for a bigger one  But they was all
locked and chained so he took my canoe and said for me to wait till he
come back or I could hunt around further or maybe I better go down home
and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to  But I said I didnt
so I told him just how to find the raft and then he started

I struck an idea pretty soon  I says to myself sposn he cant fix that
leg just in three shakes of a sheeps tail as the saying is sposn it
takes him three or four days  What are we going to dolay around there
till he lets the cat out of the bag  No sir I know what ILL do  Ill
wait and when he comes back if he says hes got to go any more Ill get
down there too if I swim and well take and tie him and keep him and
shove out down the river and when Toms done with him well give him
what its worth or all we got and then let him get ashore

So then I crept into a lumberpile to get some sleep and next time I
waked up the sun was away up over my head  I shot out and went for the
doctors house but they told me hed gone away in the night some time or
other and warnt back yet  Well thinks I that looks powerful bad for
Tom and Ill dig out for the island right off  So away I shoved and
turned the corner and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silass stomach
He says

Why TOM  Where you been all this time you rascal

I haint been nowheres I says only just hunting for the runaway
niggerme and Sid

Why where ever did you go he says  Your aunts been mighty uneasy

She neednt I says because we was all right  We followed the men
and the dogs but they outrun us and we lost them but we thought we
heard them on the water so we got a canoe and took out after them and
crossed over but couldnt find nothing of them so we cruised along
upshore till we got kind of tired and beat out and tied up the canoe
and went to sleep and never waked up till about an hour ago then we
paddled over here to hear the news and Sids at the postoffice to see
what he can hear and Im abranching out to get something to eat for us
and then were going home

So then we went to the postoffice to get Sid but just as I
suspicioned he warnt there so the old man he got a letter out of the
office and we waited awhile longer but Sid didnt come so the old man
said come along let Sid foot it home or canoe it when he got done
fooling aroundbut we would ride  I couldnt get him to let me stay and
wait for Sid and he said there warnt no use in it and I must come
along and let Aunt Sally see we was all right

When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried
both and hugged me and give me one of them lickings of hern that dont
amount to shucks and said shed serve Sid the same when he come

And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers wives to dinner and
such another clack a body never heard  Old Mrs Hotchkiss was the worst
her tongue was agoing all the time  She says

Well Sister Phelps Ive ransacked thatair cabin over an I blieve

disremember now and my new calico dress and me and Silas and my Sid and
Tom on the constant watch day AND night as I was atelling you and not
a one of us could catch hide nor hair nor sight nor sound of them and

our noses and fools us and not only fools US but the Injun Territory
robbers too and actuly gets AWAY with that nigger safe and sound and
that with sixteen men and twentytwo dogs right on their very heels at

Well it does beat

Laws alive I never

So help me I wouldnt a be

HOUSEthieves as well as

Goodnessgracioussakes Id a ben afeard to live in sich a

Fraid to LIVEwhy I was that scared I dasnt hardly go to bed or
get up or lay down or SET down Sister Ridgeway  Why theyd steal the
verywhy goodness sakes you can guess what kind of a fluster I was
in by the time midnight come last night  I hope to gracious if I warnt
afraid theyd steal some o the family  I was just to that pass I didnt
have no reasoning faculties no more  It looks foolish enough NOW in the
daytime but I says to myself theres my two poor boys asleep way up
stairs in that lonesome room and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy
t I crep up there and locked em in  I DID  And anybody would
Because you know when you get scared that way and it keeps running on
and getting worse and worse all the time and your wits gets to addling
and you get to doing all sorts o wild things and by and by you think to
yourself sposn I was a boy and was away up there and the door aint
locked and you She stopped looking kind of wondering and then she
turned her head around slow and when her eye lit on meI got up and
took a walk

Says I to myself I can explain better how we come to not be in that room
this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little  So I
done it  But I dasnt go fur or shed a sent for me  And when it was
late in the day the people all went and then I come in and told her the
noise and shooting waked up me and Sid and the door was locked and we
wanted to see the fun so we went down the lightningrod and both of us
got hurt a little and we didnt never want to try THAT no more  And
then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before and then
she said shed forgive us and maybe it was all right enough anyway and
about what a body might expect of boys for all boys was a pretty
harumscarum lot as fur as she could see and so as long as no harm
hadnt come of it she judged she better put in her time being grateful
we was alive and well and she had us still stead of fretting over what
was past and done  So then she kissed me and patted me on the head and
dropped into a kind of a brown study and pretty soon jumps up and says

Why lawsamercy its most night and Sid not come yet  What HAS become
of that boy

I see my chance so I skips up and says

Ill run right up to town and get him I says

No you wont she says  Youll stay right wher you are ONES enough
to be lost at a time  If he aint here to supper your uncle ll go

Well he warnt there to supper so right after supper uncle went

He come back about ten a little bit uneasy hadnt run across Toms
track Aunt Sally was a good DEAL uneasy but Uncle Silas he said there
warnt no occasion to beboys will be boys he said and youll see this
one turn up in the morning all sound and right  So she had to be
satisfied  But she said shed set up for him a while anyway and keep a
light burning so he could see it

And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her
candle and tucked me in and mothered me so good I felt mean and like I
couldnt look her in the face and she set down on the bed and talked
with me a long time and said what a splendid boy Sid was and didnt
seem to want to ever stop talking about him and kept asking me every now
and then if I reckoned he could a got lost or hurt or maybe drownded
and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead and she
not by him to help him and so the tears would drip down silent and I
would tell her that Sid was all right and would be home in the morning
sure and she would squeeze my hand or maybe kiss me and tell me to say
it again and keep on saying it because it done her good and she was in
so much trouble  And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes
so steady and gentle and says

The door aint going to be locked Tom and theres the window and the
rod but youll be good WONT you  And you wont go  For MY sake

Laws knows I WANTED to go bad enough to see about Tom and was all
intending to go but after that I wouldnt a went not for kingdoms

But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind so I slept very restless
And twice I went down the rod away in the night and slipped around
front and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her
eyes towards the road and the tears in them and I wished I could do
something for her but I couldnt only to swear that I wouldnt never do
nothing to grieve her any more  And the third time I waked up at dawn
and slid down and she was there yet and her candle was most out and
her old gray head was resting on her hand and she was asleep




CHAPTER XLII

THE old man was uptown again before breakfast but couldnt get no track
of Tom and both of them set at the table thinking and not saying
nothing and looking mournful and their coffee getting cold and not
eating anything And by and by the old man says

Did I give you the letter

What letter

The one I got yesterday out of the postoffice

No you didnt give me no letter

Well I must a forgot it

So he rummaged his pockets and then went off somewheres where he had
laid it down and fetched it and give it to her  She says

Why its from St Petersburgits from Sis

I allowed another walk would do me good but I couldnt stir  But before
she could break it open she dropped it and runfor she see something
And so did I It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress and that old doctor and
Jim in HER calico dress with his hands tied behind him and a lot of
people  I hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy and
rushed  She flung herself at Tom crying and says

Oh hes dead hes dead I know hes dead

And Tom he turned his head a little and muttered something or other
which showed he warnt in his right mind then she flung up her hands
and says

Hes alive thank God  And thats enough and she snatched a kiss of
him and flew for the house to get the bed ready and scattering orders
right and left at the niggers and everybody else as fast as her tongue
could go every jump of the way

I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim and the old
doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house  The men was
very huffy and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all the
other niggers around there so they wouldnt be trying to run away like
Jim done and making such a raft of trouble and keeping a whole family
scared most to death for days and nights  But the others said dont do
it it wouldnt answer at all he aint our nigger and his owner would
turn up and make us pay for him sure  So that cooled them down a
little because the people thats always the most anxious for to hang a
nigger that haint done just right is always the very ones that aint the
most anxious to pay for him when theyve got their satisfaction out of
him

They cussed Jim considerble though and give him a cuff or two side the
head once in a while but Jim never said nothing and he never let on to
know me and they took him to the same cabin and put his own clothes on
him and chained him again and not to no bedleg this time but to a big
staple drove into the bottom log and chained his hands too and both
legs and said he warnt to have nothing but bread and water to eat after
this till his owner come or he was sold at auction because he didnt
come in a certain length of time and filled up our hole and said a
couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every
night and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime and about this time
they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl
goodbye cussing and then the old doctor comes and takes a look and
says

Dont be no rougher on him than youre obleeged to because he aint a
bad nigger  When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldnt cut the
bullet out without some help and he warnt in no condition for me to
leave to go and get help and he got a little worse and a little worse
and after a long time he went out of his head and wouldnt let me come
anigh him any more and said if I chalked his raft hed kill me and no
end of wild foolishness like that and I see I couldnt do anything at
all with him so I says I got to have HELP somehow and the minute I
says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says hell help and
he done it too and done it very well  Of course I judged he must be a
runaway nigger and there I WAS and there I had to stick right straight
along all the rest of the day and all night  It was a fix I tell you
I had a couple of patients with the chills and of course Id of liked to
run up to town and see them but I dasnt because the nigger might get
away and then Id be to blame and yet never a skiff come close enough
for me to hail  So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this
morning and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller
and yet he was risking his freedom to do it and was all tired out too
and I see plain enough hed been worked main hard lately  I liked the
nigger for that I tell you gentlemen a nigger like that is worth a
thousand dollarsand kind treatment too  I had everything I needed
and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at homebetter
maybe because it was so quiet but there I WAS with both of m on my
hands and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning then some
men in a skiff come by and as good luck would have it the nigger was
setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep so
I motioned them in quiet and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and
tied him before he knowed what he was about and we never had no trouble
And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep too we muffled the oars
and hitched the raft on and towed her over very nice and quiet and the
nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start  He aint
no bad nigger gentlemen thats what I think about him

Somebody says

Well it sounds very good doctor Im obleeged to say

Then the others softened up a little too and I was mighty thankful to
that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn and I was glad it was
according to my judgment of him too because I thought he had a good
heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him  Then they all
agreed that Jim had acted very well and was deserving to have some
notice took of it and reward  So every one of them promised right out
and hearty that they wouldnt cuss him no more

Then they come out and locked him up  I hoped they was going to say he
could have one or two of the chains took off because they was rotten
heavy or could have meat and greens with his bread and water but they
didnt think of it and I reckoned it warnt best for me to mix in but I
judged Id get the doctors yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon
as Id got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me
explanations I mean of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot
when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling
around hunting the runaway nigger

But I had plenty time  Aunt Sally she stuck to the sickroom all day and
all night and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him

Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better and they said Aunt Sally
was gone to get a nap  So I slips to the sickroom and if I found him
awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash
But he was sleeping and sleeping very peaceful too and pale not
firefaced the way he was when he come  So I set down and laid for him
to wake  In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in and there I
was up a stump again  She motioned me to be still and set down by me
and begun to whisper and said we could all be joyful now because all
the symptoms was firstrate and hed been sleeping like that for ever so
long and looking better and peacefuller all the time and ten to one
hed wake up in his right mind

So we set there watching and by and by he stirs a bit and opened his
eyes very natural and takes a look and says

Hellowhy Im at HOME  Hows that  Wheres the raft

Its all right I says

And JIM

The same I says but couldnt say it pretty brash  But he never
noticed but says

Good  Splendid  NOW were all right and safe Did you tell Aunty

I was going to say yes but she chipped in and says  About what Sid

Why about the way the whole thing was done

What whole thing

Why THE whole thing  There aint but one how we set the runaway
nigger freeme and Tom

Good land  Set the runWhat IS the child talking about  Dear dear
out of his head again

NO I aint out of my HEAD I know all what Im talking about  We DID
set him freeme and Tom  We laid out to do it and we DONE it  And we
done it elegant too  Hed got a start and she never checked him up
just set and stared and stared and let him clip along and I see it
warnt no use for ME to put in  Why Aunty it cost us a power of work
weeks of ithours and hours every night whilst you was all asleep
And we had to steal candles and the sheet and the shirt and your
dress and spoons and tin plates and caseknives and the warmingpan
and the grindstone and flour and just no end of things and you cant
think what work it was to make the saws and pens and inscriptions and
one thing or another and you cant think HALF the fun it was  And we
had to make up the pictures of coffins and things and nonnamous letters
from the robbers and get up and down the lightningrod and dig the hole
into the cabin and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a
pie and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket

Mercy sakes

and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on for company for
Jim and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that
you come near spiling the whole business because the men come before we
was out of the cabin and we had to rush and they heard us and let drive
at us and I got my share and we dodged out of the path and let them go
by and when the dogs come they warnt interested in us but went for the
most noise and we got our canoe and made for the raft and was all
safe and Jim was a free man and we done it all by ourselves and WASNT
it bully Aunty

Well I never heard the likes of it in all my born days  So it was YOU
you little rapscallions thats been making all this trouble and turned
everybodys wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death  Ive
as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o you this very
minute  To think here Ive been night after night aYOU just get
well once you young scamp and I lay Ill tan the Old Harry out o both
o ye

But Tom he WAS so proud and joyful he just COULDNT hold in and his
tongue just WENT itshe achipping in and spitting fire all along and
both of them going it at once like a cat convention and she says

WELL you get all the enjoyment you can out of it NOW for mind I tell
you if I catch you meddling with him again

Meddling with WHO  Tom says dropping his smile and looking surprised

With WHO  Why the runaway nigger of course  Whod you reckon

Tom looks at me very grave and says

Tom didnt you just tell me he was all right  Hasnt he got away

HIM says Aunt Sally the runaway nigger  Deed he hasnt  Theyve
got him back safe and sound and hes in that cabin again on bread and
water and loaded down with chains till hes claimed or sold

Tom rose square up in bed with his eye hot and his nostrils opening and
shutting like gills and sings out to me

They haint no RIGHT to shut him up  SHOVEand dont you lose a
minute  Turn him loose he aint no slave hes as free as any cretur
that walks this earth

What DOES the child mean

I mean every word I SAY Aunt Sally and if somebody dont go ILL go
Ive knowed him all his life and so has Tom there  Old Miss Watson
died two months ago and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him
down the river and SAID so and she set him free in her will

Then what on earth did YOU want to set him free for seeing he was
already free

Well that IS a question I must say and just like women  Why I
wanted the ADVENTURE of it and Id a waded neckdeep in blood to
goodness alive AUNT POLLY

If she warnt standing right there just inside the door looking as
sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie I wish I may never

Aunt Sally jumped for her and most hugged the head off of her and cried
over her and I found a good enough place for me under the bed for it
was getting pretty sultry for us seemed to me  And I peeped out and in
a little while Toms Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there
looking across at Tom over her spectacleskind of grinding him into the
earth you know  And then she says

Yes you BETTER turn yr head awayI would if I was you Tom

Oh deary me says Aunt Sally IS he changed so  Why that aint TOM
its Sid TomsTomswhy where is Tom  He was here a minute ago

You mean wheres Huck FINNthats what you mean  I reckon I haint
raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I SEE
him  That WOULD be a pretty howdydo  Come out from under that bed
Huck Finn

So I done it  But not feeling brash

Aunt Sally she was one of the mixedupestlooking persons I ever see
except one and that was Uncle Silas when he come in and they told it
all to him  It kind of made him drunk as you may say and he didnt
know nothing at all the rest of the day and preached a prayermeeting
sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation because the oldest
man in the world couldnt a understood it  So Toms Aunt Polly she told
all about who I was and what and I had to up and tell how I was in such
a tight place that when Mrs Phelps took me for Tom Sawyershe chipped
in and says Oh go on and call me Aunt Sally Im used to it now and
taint no need to changethat when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I
had to stand itthere warnt no other way and I knowed he wouldnt
mind because it would be nuts for him being a mystery and hed make an
adventure out of it and be perfectly satisfied  And so it turned out
and he let on to be Sid and made things as soft as he could for me

And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting
Jim free in her will and so sure enough Tom Sawyer had gone and took
all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free and I couldnt
ever understand before until that minute and that talk how he COULD
help a body set a nigger free with his bringingup

Well Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and
SID had come all right and safe she says to herself

Look at that now  I might have expected it letting him go off that
way without anybody to watch him  So now I got to go and trapse all the
way down the river eleven hundred mile and find out what that creeturs
up to THIS time as long as I couldnt seem to get any answer out of you
about it

Why I never heard nothing from you says Aunt Sally

Well I wonder  Why I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean
by Sid being here

Well I never got em Sis

Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe and says

You Tom

WellWHAT he says kind of pettish

Don t you what ME you impudent thinghand out them letters

What letters

THEM letters  I be bound if I have to take aholt of you Ill

Theyre in the trunk  There now  And theyre just the same as they
was when I got them out of the office  I haint looked into them I
haint touched them  But I knowed theyd make trouble and I thought if
you warnt in no hurry Id

Well you DO need skinning there aint no mistake about it  And I
wrote another one to tell you I was coming and I spose he

No it come yesterday I haint read it yet but ITS all right Ive
got that one

I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadnt but I reckoned maybe it
was just as safe to not to  So I never said nothing




CHAPTER THE LAST

THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea time
of the evasionwhat it was hed planned to do if the evasion worked all
right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before
And he said what he had planned in his head from the start if we got
Jim out all safe was for us to run him down the river on the raft and
have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river and then tell him about
his being free and take him back up home on a steamboat in style and
pay him for his lost time and write word ahead and get out all the
niggers around and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
procession and a brassband and then he would be a hero and so would
we  But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was

We had Jim out of the chains in no time and when Aunt Polly and Uncle
Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom
they made a heap of fuss over him and fixed him up prime and give him
all he wanted to eat and a good time and nothing to do  And we had him
up to the sickroom and had a high talk and Tom give Jim forty dollars
for being prisoner for us so patient and doing it up so good and Jim
was pleased most to death and busted out and says

DAH now Huck what I tell youwhat I tell you up dah on Jackson
islan  I TOLE you I got a hairy breas en whats de sign un it en I
TOLE you I ben rich wunst en gwineter to be rich AGIN en its come
true en heah she is  DAH now doan talk to MEsigns is SIGNS mine I
tell you en I knowed jis s well at I uz gwineter be rich agin as Is
astannin heah dis minute

And then Tom he talked along and talked along and says les all three
slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit and go for
howling adventures amongst the Injuns over in the Territory for a
couple of weeks or two and I says all right that suits me but I aint
got no money for to buy the outfit and I reckon I couldnt get none from
home because its likely paps been back before now and got it all away
from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up

No he haint Tom says its all there yetsix thousand dollars and
more and your pap haint ever been back since  Hadnt when I come away
anyhow

Jim says kind of solemn

He aint acomin back no mo Huck

I says

Why Jim

Nemmine why Huckbut he aint comin back no mo

But I kept at him so at last he says

Doan you member de house dat was floatn down de river en dey wuz a
man in dah kivered up en I went in en unkivered him and didn let you
come in  Well den you kin git yo money when you wants it kase dat
wuz him

Toms most well now and got his bullet around his neck on a watchguard
for a watch and is always seeing what time it is and so there aint
nothing more to write about and I am rotten glad of it because if Id a
knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I wouldnt a tackled it and
aint agoing to no more  But I reckon I got to light out for the
Territory ahead of the rest because Aunt Sally shes going to adopt me
and sivilize me and I cant stand it  I been there before

Section 4  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenbergtm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment  Many small donations
1 to 5000 are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit httppglaforg

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate

International donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States  US laws alone swamp our small staff

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks online payments and credit card
donations  To donate please visit httppglaforgdonate


Section 5  General Information About Project Gutenbergtm electronic
works

Professor Michael S Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenbergtm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone  For thirty years he produced and distributed Project
Gutenbergtm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support


Project Gutenbergtm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the US
unless a copyright notice is included  Thus we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition
